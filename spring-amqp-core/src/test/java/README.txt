Many of the "integration" tests here require a running RabbitMQ server.

If RabbitMQ is not installed on your system, refer to the instructions for your
particular OS here: http://www.rabbitmq.com/install.html

Start the server. For example, and a *nix-based system where RabbitMQ has been
installed within /opt/rabbitmq, issue the following command:
> sudo /opt/rabbitmq/sbin/rabbitmq-server start
