[[amqp-client]]
= RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 Support

Version 4.0 introduces `spring-rabbitmq-client` module for https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries[AMQP 1.0] protocol support on RabbitMQ.

This artifact is based on the {rabbitmq-github}/rabbitmq-amqp-java-client[com.rabbitmq.client:amqp-client] library and therefore can work only with RabbitMQ and its AMQP 1.0 protocol support.
It cannot be used for any arbitrary AMQP 1.0 broker.
For that purpose a https://qpid.apache.org/components/jms/index.html[JMS bridge] and respective {spring-framework-docs}/integration/jms.html[Spring JMS] integration is recommended so far.

This dependency has to be added to the project to be able to interact with RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 support:

The `spring-rabbit` (for AMQP 0.9.1 protocol) comes as a transitive dependency for reusing some common API in this new client, for example, exceptions, the `@RabbitListener` support.
It is not necessary to use both functionality in the target project, but RabbitMQ allows both AMQP 0.9.1 and 1.0 co-exists.

For more information about RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 Java Client see its https://www.rabbitmq.com/client-libraries/amqp-client-libraries[documentation].

[[amqp-client-environment]]
== RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 Environment

The `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Environment` is the first thing which has to be added to the project for connection management and other common settings.
It is an entry point to a node or a cluster of nodes.
The environment allows creating connections.
It can contain infrastructure-related configuration settings shared between connections, e.g. pools of threads, metrics and/or observation:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
Environment environment() {
    return new AmqpEnvironmentBuilder()
            .connectionSettings()
            .port(5672)
            .environmentBuilder()
            .build();
}
----

The same `Environment` instance can be used for connecting to different RabbitMQ brokers, then connection setting must be provided on specific connection.
See below.

[[amqp-client-connection-factory]]
== AMQP Connection Factory

The `org.springframework.amqp.rabbitmq.client.AmqpConnectionFactory` abstraction was introduced to manage `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Connection`.
Don't confuse it with a `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.ConnectionFactory` which is only for AMQP 0.9.1 protocol.
The `SingleAmqpConnectionFactory` implementation is present to manage one connection and its settings.
The same `Connection` can be shared between many producers, consumers and management.
The multi-plexing is handled by the link abstraction for AMQP 1.0 protocol implementation internally in the AMQP client library.
The `Connection` has recovery capabilities and also handles topology.

In most cases there is just enough to add this bean into the project:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory(Environment environment) {
    return new SingleAmqpConnectionFactory(environment);
}
----

See `SingleAmqpConnectionFactory` setters for all connection-specific setting.

[[amqp-client-topology]]
== RabbitMQ Topology Management

For topology management (exchanges, queues and binding between) from the application perspective, the `RabbitAmqpAdmin` is present, which is an implementation of existing `AmqpAdmin` interface:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
RabbitAmqpAdmin admin(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RabbitAmqpAdmin(connectionFactory);
}
----

The same bean definitions for `Exchange`, `Queue`, `Binding` and `Declarables` instances as described in the xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc[] has to be used to manage topology.
The `RabbitAdmin` from `spring-rabbit` can also do that, but it happens against AMQP 0.9.1 connection, and since `RabbitAmqpAdmin` is based on the AMQP 1.0 connection, the topology recovery is handled smoothly from there, together with publishers and consumers recovery.

The `RabbitAmqpAdmin` performs respective beans scanning in its `start()` lifecycle callback.
The `initialize()`, as well-as all other RabbitMQ entities management methods can be called manually at runtime.
Internally the `RabbitAmqpAdmin` uses `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Connection.management()` API to perform respective topology manipulations.

[[amqp-client-template]]
== `RabbitAmqpTemplate`

The `RabbitAmqpTemplate` is an implementation of the `AsyncAmqpTemplate` and performs various send/receive operations with AMQP 1.0 protocol.
Requires an `AmqpConnectionFactory` and can be configured with some defaults.
Even if `com.rabbitmq.client:amqp-client` library comes with a `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Message`, the `RabbitAmqpTemplate` still exposes an API based on the well-known `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` with all the supporting classes like `MessageProperties` and `MessageConverter` abstraction.
The conversion to/from `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Message` is done internally in the `RabbitAmqpTemplate`.
All the methods return a `CompletableFuture` to obtain operation results eventually.
The operations with plain object require message body conversion and `SimpleMessageConverter` is used by default.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc[] for more information about conversions.

Usually, just one bean like this is enough to perform all the possible template pattern operation:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
RabbitAmqpTemplate rabbitTemplate(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RabbitAmqpTemplate(connectionFactory);
}
----

It can be configured for some default exchange and routing key or just queue.
The `RabbitAmqpTemplate` have a default queue for receive operation and another default queue for request-reply operation where temporary queue is created for the request by the client if not present.

Here are some samples of `RabbitAmqpTemplate` operations:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
DirectExchange e1() {
    return new DirectExchange("e1");
}

@Bean
Queue q1() {
    return QueueBuilder.durable("q1").deadLetterExchange("dlx1").build();
}

@Bean
Binding b1() {
    return BindingBuilder.bind(q1()).to(e1()).with("k1");
}

...

@Test
void defaultExchangeAndRoutingKey() {
    this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.setExchange("e1");
    this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.setRoutingKey("k1");
	this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.setReceiveQueue("q1");

    assertThat(this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.convertAndSend("test1"))
            .succeedsWithin(Duration.ofSeconds(10));

    assertThat(this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.receiveAndConvert())
            .succeedsWithin(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
            .isEqualTo("test1");
}
----

Here we declared an `e1` exchange, `q1` queue and bind it into that exchange with a `k1` routing key.
Then we use a default setting for `RabbitAmqpTemplate` to publish messages to the mentioned exchange with the respective routing key and use `q1` as default queue for receiving operations.
There are overloaded variants for those methods to send to specific exchange or queue (for send and receive).
The `receiveAndConvert()` operations with a `ParameterizedTypeReference<T>` requires a `SmartMessageConverter` to be injected into the `RabbitAmqpTemplate`.

The next example demonstrate and RPC implementation with `RabbitAmqpTemplate` (assuming same RabbitMQ objects as in the previous example):

[source,java]
----
@Test
void verifyRpc() {
    String testRequest = "rpc-request";
    String testReply = "rpc-reply";

    CompletableFuture<Object> rpcClientResult = this.template.convertSendAndReceive("e1", "k1", testRequest);

    AtomicReference<String> receivedRequest = new AtomicReference<>();
    CompletableFuture<Boolean> rpcServerResult =
            this.rabbitAmqpTemplate.<String, String>receiveAndReply("q1",
                     payload -> {
                         receivedRequest.set(payload);
                         return testReply;
                     });

    assertThat(rpcServerResult).succeedsWithin(Duration.ofSeconds(10)).isEqualTo(true);
    assertThat(rpcClientResult).succeedsWithin(Duration.ofSeconds(10)).isEqualTo(testReply);
    assertThat(receivedRequest.get()).isEqualTo(testRequest);
}
----

The correlation and `replyTo` queue are managed internally.
The server side can be implemented with a `@RabbitListener` POJO method described below.

[[amqp-client-listener]]
== The RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 Consumer

As with many other messaging implementations for consumer side, the `spring-rabbitmq-client` modules comes with the `RabbitAmqpListenerContainer` which is, essentially, an implementation of well-know `MessageListenerContainer`.
It does exactly the same as `DirectMessageListenerContainer`, but for RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 support.
Requires an `AmqpConnectionFactory` and at least one queue to consume from.
Also, the `MessageListener` (or AMQP 1.0 specific `RabbitAmqpMessageListener`) must be provided.
Can be configured with an `autoSettle = false`, with the meaning of `AcknowledgeMode.MANUAL`.
In that case, the `Message` provided to the `MessageListener` has in its `MessageProperties` an `AmqpAcknowledgment` callback for target logic consideration.

The `RabbitAmqpMessageListener` has a contract for `com.rabbitmq.client:amqp-client` abstractions:

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Process an AMQP message.
 * @param message the message to process.
 * @param context the consumer context to settle message.
 *                Null if container is configured for {@code autoSettle}.
 */
void onAmqpMessage(Message message, Consumer.Context context);
----

Where the first argument is a native received `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Message` and `context` is a native callback for message settlement, similar to the mentioned above `AmqpAcknowledgment` abstraction.

The `RabbitAmqpMessageListener` can handle and settle messages in batches when `batchSize` option is provided.
For this purpose the `MessageListener.onMessageBatch()` contract must be implemented.
The `batchReceiveDuration` option is used to schedule a force release for not full batches to avoid memory and https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2024/09/02/amqp-flow-control[consumer credits] exhausting.

Usually, the `RabbitAmqpMessageListener` class is not used directly in the target project, and POJO method annotation configuration via `@RabbitListener` is chosen for declarative consumer configuration.
The `RabbitAmqpListenerContainerFactory` must be registered under the `RabbitListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.DEFAULT_RABBIT_LISTENER_CONTAINER_FACTORY_BEAN_NAME`, and `@RabbitListener` annotation process will register `RabbitAmqpMessageListener` instance into the `RabbitListenerEndpointRegistry`.
The target POJO method invocation is handled by specific `RabbitAmqpMessageListenerAdapter` implementation, which extends a `MessagingMessageListenerAdapter` and reuses a lot of its functionality, including request-reply scenarios (async or not).
So, all the concepts described in the xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[] are applied with this `RabbitAmqpMessageListener` as well.

In addition to traditional messaging `payload` and `headers`, the `@RabbitListener` POJO method contract can be with these parameters:

* `com.rabbitmq.client.amqp.Message` - the native AMQP 1.0 message without any conversions;
* `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` - Spring AMQP message abstraction as conversion result from the native AMQP 1.0 message;
* `org.springframework.messaging.Message` - Spring Messaging abstraction as conversion result from the Spring AMQP message;
* `Consumer.Context` - RabbitMQ AMQP client consumer settlement API;
* `org.springframework.amqp.core.AmqpAcknowledgment` - Spring AMQP acknowledgment abstraction: delegates to the `Consumer.Context`.

The following example demonstrates a simple `@RabbitListener` for RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 interaction with the manual settlement:

[source,java]
----
@Bean(RabbitListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.DEFAULT_RABBIT_LISTENER_CONTAINER_FACTORY_BEAN_NAME)
RabbitAmqpListenerContainerFactory rabbitAmqpListenerContainerFactory(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return new RabbitAmqpListenerContainerFactory(connectionFactory);
}

final List<String> received = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());

CountDownLatch consumeIsDone = new CountDownLatch(11);

@RabbitListener(queues = {"q1", "q2"},
        ackMode = "#{T(org.springframework.amqp.core.AcknowledgeMode).MANUAL}",
        concurrency = "2",
        id = "testAmqpListener")
void processQ1AndQ2Data(String data, AmqpAcknowledgment acknowledgment, Consumer.Context context) {
    try {
        if ("discard".equals(data)) {
            if (!this.received.contains(data)) {
                context.discard();
            }
            else {
                throw new MessageConversionException("Test message is rejected");
            }
        }
        else if ("requeue".equals(data) && !this.received.contains(data)) {
            acknowledgment.acknowledge(AmqpAcknowledgment.Status.REQUEUE);
        }
        else {
            acknowledgment.acknowledge();
        }
        this.received.add(data);
    }
    finally {
        this.consumeIsDone.countDown();
    }
}
