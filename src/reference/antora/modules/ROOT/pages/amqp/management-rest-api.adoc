= RabbitMQ REST API
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

When the management plugin is enabled, the RabbitMQ server exposes a REST API to monitor and configure the broker.
A {rabbitmq-github}/hop[Java Binding for the API] is now provided.
The `com.rabbitmq.http.client.Client` is a standard, immediate, and, therefore, blocking API.
It is based on the {spring-framework-docs}/web.html[Spring Web] module and its `RestTemplate` implementation.
On the other hand, the `com.rabbitmq.http.client.ReactorNettyClient` is a reactive, non-blocking implementation based on the https://projectreactor.io/docs/netty/release/reference/docs/index.html[Reactor Netty] project.

The hop dependency (`com.rabbitmq:http-client`) is now also `optional`.

See their Javadoc for more information.
