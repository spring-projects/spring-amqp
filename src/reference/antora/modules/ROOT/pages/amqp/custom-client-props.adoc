= Adding Custom Client Connection Properties

The `CachingConnectionFactory` now lets you access the underlying connection factory to allow, for example,
setting custom client properties.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
connectionFactory.getRabbitConnectionFactory().getClientProperties().put("thing1", "thing2");
----

These properties appear in the RabbitMQ Admin UI when viewing the connection.
