[[broker-configuration]]
= Configuring the Broker

The AMQP specification describes how the protocol can be used to configure queues, exchanges, and bindings on the broker.
These operations (which are portable from the 0.8 specification and higher) are present in the `AmqpAdmin` interface in the `org.springframework.amqp.core` package.
The RabbitMQ implementation of that class is `RabbitAdmin` located in the `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core` package.

The `AmqpAdmin` interface is based on using the Spring AMQP domain abstractions and is shown in the following listing:

[source,java]
----
public interface AmqpAdmin {

    // Exchange Operations

    void declareExchange(Exchange exchange);

    void deleteExchange(String exchangeName);

    // Queue Operations

    Queue declareQueue();

    String declareQueue(Queue queue);

    void deleteQueue(String queueName);

    void deleteQueue(String queueName, boolean unused, boolean empty);

    void purgeQueue(String queueName, boolean noWait);

    // Binding Operations

    void declareBinding(Binding binding);

    void removeBinding(Binding binding);

    Properties getQueueProperties(String queueName);

}
----

See also xref:amqp/template.adoc#scoped-operations[Scoped Operations].

The `getQueueProperties()` method returns some limited information about the queue (message count and consumer count).
The keys for the properties returned are available as constants in the `RabbitTemplate` (`QUEUE_NAME`,
`QUEUE_MESSAGE_COUNT`, and `QUEUE_CONSUMER_COUNT`).
The xref:amqp/management-rest-api.adoc#management-rest-api[RabbitMQ REST API] provides much more information in the `QueueInfo` object.

The no-arg `declareQueue()` method defines a queue on the broker with a name that is automatically generated.
The additional properties of this auto-generated queue are `exclusive=true`, `autoDelete=true`, and `durable=false`.

The `declareQueue(Queue queue)` method takes a `Queue` object and returns the name of the declared queue.
If the `name` property of the provided `Queue` is an empty `String`, the broker declares the queue with a generated name.
That name is returned to the caller.
That name is also added to the `actualName` property of the `Queue`.
You can use this functionality programmatically only by invoking the `RabbitAdmin` directly.
When using auto-declaration by the admin when defining a queue declaratively in the application context, you can set the name property to `""` (the empty string).
The broker then creates the name.
Starting with version 2.1, listener containers can use queues of this type.
See xref:amqp/containers-and-broker-named-queues.adoc[Containers and Broker-Named queues] for more information.

This is in contrast to an `AnonymousQueue` where the framework generates a unique (`UUID`) name and sets `durable` to
`false` and `exclusive`, `autoDelete` to `true`.
A `<rabbit:queue/>` with an empty (or missing) `name` attribute always creates an `AnonymousQueue`.

See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#anonymous-queue[`AnonymousQueue`] to understand why `AnonymousQueue` is preferred over broker-generated queue names as well as
how to control the format of the name.
Starting with version 2.1, anonymous queues are declared with argument `Queue.X_QUEUE_LEADER_LOCATOR` set to `client-local` by default.
This ensures that the queue is declared on the node to which the application is connected.
Declarative queues must have fixed names because they might be referenced elsewhere in the context -- such as in the
listener shown in the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:listener-container>
    <rabbit:listener ref="listener" queue-names="#{someQueue.name}" />
</rabbit:listener-container>
----

See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#automatic-declaration[Automatic Declaration of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings].

The RabbitMQ implementation of this interface is `RabbitAdmin`, which, when configured by using Spring XML, resembles the following example:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:connection-factory id="connectionFactory"/>

<rabbit:admin id="amqpAdmin" connection-factory="connectionFactory"/>
----

When the `CachingConnectionFactory` cache mode is `CHANNEL` (the default), the `RabbitAdmin` implementation does automatic lazy declaration of queues, exchanges, and bindings declared in the same `ApplicationContext`.
These components are declared as soon as a `Connection` is opened to the broker.
There are some namespace features that make this very convenient -- for example,
in the Stocks sample application, we have the following:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue id="tradeQueue"/>

<rabbit:queue id="marketDataQueue"/>

<fanout-exchange name="broadcast.responses"
                 xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/rabbit">
    <bindings>
        <binding queue="tradeQueue"/>
    </bindings>
</fanout-exchange>

<topic-exchange name="app.stock.marketdata"
                xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/rabbit">
    <bindings>
        <binding queue="marketDataQueue" pattern="${stocks.quote.pattern}"/>
    </bindings>
</topic-exchange>
----

In the preceding example, we use anonymous queues (actually, internally, just queues with names generated by the framework, not by the broker) and refer to them by ID.
We can also declare queues with explicit names, which also serve as identifiers for their bean definitions in the context.
The following example configures a queue with an explicit name:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue name="stocks.trade.queue"/>
----

TIP: You can provide both `id` and `name` attributes.
This lets you refer to the queue (for example, in a binding) by an ID that is independent of the queue name.
It also allows standard Spring features (such as property placeholders and SpEL expressions for the queue name).
These features are not available when you use the name as the bean identifier.

Queues can be configured with additional arguments -- for example, `x-message-ttl`.
When you use the namespace support, they are provided in the form of a `Map` of argument-name/argument-value pairs, which are defined by using the `<rabbit:queue-arguments>` element.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue name="withArguments">
    <rabbit:queue-arguments>
        <entry key="x-dead-letter-exchange" value="myDLX"/>
        <entry key="x-dead-letter-routing-key" value="dlqRK"/>
    </rabbit:queue-arguments>
</rabbit:queue>
----

By default, the arguments are assumed to be strings.
For arguments of other types, you must provide the type.
The following example shows how to specify the type:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue name="withArguments">
    <rabbit:queue-arguments value-type="java.lang.Long">
        <entry key="x-message-ttl" value="100"/>
    </rabbit:queue-arguments>
</rabbit:queue>
----

When providing arguments of mixed types, you must provide the type for each entry element.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue name="withArguments">
    <rabbit:queue-arguments>
        <entry key="x-message-ttl">
            <value type="java.lang.Long">100</value>
        </entry>
        <entry key="x-dead-letter-exchange" value="myDLX"/>
        <entry key="x-dead-letter-routing-key" value="dlqRK"/>
    </rabbit:queue-arguments>
</rabbit:queue>
----

With Spring Framework 3.2 and later, this can be declared a little more succinctly, as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:queue name="withArguments">
    <rabbit:queue-arguments>
        <entry key="x-message-ttl" value="100" value-type="java.lang.Long"/>
        <entry key="x-ha-policy" value="all"/>
    </rabbit:queue-arguments>
</rabbit:queue>
----

When you use Java configuration, the `Queue.X_QUEUE_LEADER_LOCATOR` argument is supported as a first class property through the `setLeaderLocator()` method on the `Queue` class.
Starting with version 2.1, anonymous queues are declared with this property set to `client-local` by default.
This ensures that the queue is declared on the node the application is connected to.

IMPORTANT: The RabbitMQ broker does not allow declaration of a queue with mismatched arguments.
For example, if a `queue` already exists with no `time to live` argument, and you attempt to declare it with (for example) `key="x-message-ttl" value="100"`, an exception is thrown.

By default, the `RabbitAdmin` immediately stops processing all declarations when any exception occurs.
This could cause downstream issues, such as a listener container failing to initialize because another queue (defined after the one in error) is not declared.

This behavior can be modified by setting the `ignore-declaration-exceptions` attribute to `true` on the `RabbitAdmin` instance.
This option instructs the `RabbitAdmin` to log the exception and continue declaring other elements.
When configuring the `RabbitAdmin` using Java, this property is called `ignoreDeclarationExceptions`.
This is a global setting that applies to all elements.
Queues, exchanges, and bindings have a similar property that applies to just those elements.

Prior to version 1.6, this property took effect only if an `IOException` occurred on the channel, such as when there is a mismatch between current and desired properties.
Now, this property takes effect on any exception, including `TimeoutException` and others.

In addition, any declaration exceptions result in the publishing of a `DeclarationExceptionEvent`, which is an `ApplicationEvent` that can be consumed by any `ApplicationListener` in the context.
The event contains a reference to the admin, the element that was being declared, and the `Throwable`.

[[headers-exchange]]
== Headers Exchange

Starting with version 1.3, you can configure the `HeadersExchange` to match on multiple headers.
You can also specify whether any or all headers must match.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:headers-exchange name="headers-test">
    <rabbit:bindings>
        <rabbit:binding queue="bucket">
            <rabbit:binding-arguments>
                <entry key="foo" value="bar"/>
                <entry key="baz" value="qux"/>
                <entry key="x-match" value="all"/>
            </rabbit:binding-arguments>
        </rabbit:binding>
    </rabbit:bindings>
</rabbit:headers-exchange>
----

Starting with version 1.6, you can configure `Exchanges` with an `internal` flag (defaults to `false`) and such an
`Exchange` is properly configured on the Broker through a `RabbitAdmin` (if one is present in the application context).
If the `internal` flag is `true` for an exchange, RabbitMQ does not let clients use the exchange.
This is useful for a dead letter exchange or exchange-to-exchange binding, where you do not wish the exchange to be used
directly by publishers.

To see how to use Java to configure the AMQP infrastructure, look at the Stock sample application,
where there is the `@Configuration` class `AbstractStockRabbitConfiguration`, which ,in turn has
`RabbitClientConfiguration` and `RabbitServerConfiguration` subclasses.
The following listing shows the code for `AbstractStockRabbitConfiguration`:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public abstract class AbstractStockAppRabbitConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public CachingConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
        CachingConnectionFactory connectionFactory =
            new CachingConnectionFactory("localhost");
        connectionFactory.setUsername("guest");
        connectionFactory.setPassword("guest");
        return connectionFactory;
    }

    @Bean
    public RabbitTemplate rabbitTemplate() {
        RabbitTemplate template = new RabbitTemplate(connectionFactory());
        template.setMessageConverter(jsonMessageConverter());
        configureRabbitTemplate(template);
        return template;
    }

    @Bean
    public Jackson2JsonMessageConverter jsonMessageConverter() {
        return new Jackson2JsonMessageConverter();
    }

    @Bean
    public TopicExchange marketDataExchange() {
        return new TopicExchange("app.stock.marketdata");
    }

    // additional code omitted for brevity

}
----

In the Stock application, the server is configured by using the following `@Configuration` class:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class RabbitServerConfiguration extends AbstractStockAppRabbitConfiguration  {

    @Bean
    public Queue stockRequestQueue() {
        return new Queue("app.stock.request");
    }
}
----

This is the end of the whole inheritance chain of `@Configuration` classes.
The end result is that `TopicExchange` and `Queue` are declared to the broker upon application startup.
There is no binding of  `TopicExchange` to a queue in the server configuration, as that is done in the client application.
The stock request queue, however, is automatically bound to the AMQP default exchange.
This behavior is defined by the specification.

The client `@Configuration` class is a little more interesting.
Its declaration follows:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class RabbitClientConfiguration extends AbstractStockAppRabbitConfiguration {

    @Value("${stocks.quote.pattern}")
    private String marketDataRoutingKey;

    @Bean
    public Queue marketDataQueue() {
        return amqpAdmin().declareQueue();
    }

    /**
     * Binds to the market data exchange.
     * Interested in any stock quotes
     * that match its routing key.
     */
    @Bean
    public Binding marketDataBinding() {
        return BindingBuilder.bind(
                marketDataQueue()).to(marketDataExchange()).with(marketDataRoutingKey);
    }

    // additional code omitted for brevity

}
----

The client declares another queue through the `declareQueue()` method on the `AmqpAdmin`.
It binds that queue to the market data exchange with a routing pattern that is externalized in a properties file.


[[builder-api]]
== Builder API for Queues and Exchanges

Version 1.6 introduces a convenient fluent API for configuring `Queue` and `Exchange` objects when using Java configuration.
The following example shows how to use it:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Queue queue() {
    return QueueBuilder.nonDurable("foo")
        .autoDelete()
        .exclusive()
        .withArgument("foo", "bar")
        .build();
}

@Bean
public Exchange exchange() {
  return ExchangeBuilder.directExchange("foo")
      .autoDelete()
      .internal()
      .withArgument("foo", "bar")
      .build();
}
----

See the Javadoc for https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/api/org/springframework/amqp/core/QueueBuilder.html[`org.springframework.amqp.core.QueueBuilder`] and https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/docs/current/api/org/springframework/amqp/core/ExchangeBuilder.html[`org.springframework.amqp.core.ExchangeBuilder`] for more information.

Starting with version 2.0, the `ExchangeBuilder` now creates durable exchanges by default, to be consistent with the simple constructors on the individual `AbstractExchange` classes.
To make a non-durable exchange with the builder, use `.durable(false)` before invoking `.build()`.
The `durable()` method with no parameter is no longer provided.

Version 2.2 introduced fluent APIs to add "well known" exchange and queue arguments...

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Queue allArgs1() {
    return QueueBuilder.nonDurable("all.args.1")
            .ttl(1000)
            .expires(200_000)
            .maxLength(42)
            .maxLengthBytes(10_000)
            .overflow(Overflow.rejectPublish)
            .deadLetterExchange("dlx")
            .deadLetterRoutingKey("dlrk")
            .maxPriority(4)
            .lazy()
            .leaderLocator(LeaderLocator.minLeaders)
            .singleActiveConsumer()
            .build();
}

@Bean
public DirectExchange ex() {
    return ExchangeBuilder.directExchange("ex.with.alternate")
            .durable(true)
            .alternate("alternate")
            .build();
}
----

[[collection-declaration]]
== Declaring Collections of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings

You can wrap collections of `Declarable` objects (`Queue`, `Exchange`, and `Binding`) in `Declarables` objects.
The `RabbitAdmin` detects such beans (as well as discrete `Declarable` beans) in the application context, and declares the contained objects on the broker whenever a connection is established (initially and after a connection failure).
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public static class Config {

    @Bean
    public CachingConnectionFactory cf() {
        return new CachingConnectionFactory("localhost");
    }

    @Bean
    public RabbitAdmin admin(ConnectionFactory cf) {
        return new RabbitAdmin(cf);
    }

    @Bean
    public DirectExchange e1() {
        return new DirectExchange("e1", false, true);
    }

    @Bean
    public Queue q1() {
        return new Queue("q1", false, false, true);
    }

    @Bean
    public Binding b1() {
        return BindingBuilder.bind(q1()).to(e1()).with("k1");
    }

    @Bean
    public Declarables es() {
        return new Declarables(
                new DirectExchange("e2", false, true),
                new DirectExchange("e3", false, true));
    }

    @Bean
    public Declarables qs() {
        return new Declarables(
                new Queue("q2", false, false, true),
                new Queue("q3", false, false, true));
    }

    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public Declarables prototypes() {
        return new Declarables(new Queue(this.prototypeQueueName, false, false, true));
    }

    @Bean
    public Declarables bs() {
        return new Declarables(
                new Binding("q2", DestinationType.QUEUE, "e2", "k2", null),
                new Binding("q3", DestinationType.QUEUE, "e3", "k3", null));
    }

    @Bean
    public Declarables ds() {
        return new Declarables(
                new DirectExchange("e4", false, true),
                new Queue("q4", false, false, true),
                new Binding("q4", DestinationType.QUEUE, "e4", "k4", null));
    }

}
----

IMPORTANT: In versions prior to 2.1, you could declare multiple `Declarable` instances by defining beans of type `Collection<Declarable>`.
This can cause undesirable side effects in some cases, because the admin has to iterate over all `Collection<?>` beans.

Version 2.2 added the `getDeclarablesByType` method to `Declarables`; this can be used as a convenience, for example, when declaring the listener container bean(s).

[source, java]
----
public SimpleMessageListenerContainer container(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory,
        Declarables mixedDeclarables, MessageListener listener) {

    SimpleMessageListenerContainer container = new SimpleMessageListenerContainer(connectionFactory);
    container.setQueues(mixedDeclarables.getDeclarablesByType(Queue.class).toArray(new Queue[0]));
    container.setMessageListener(listener);
    return container;
}
----

[[conditional-declaration]]
== Conditional Declaration

By default, all queues, exchanges, and bindings are declared by all `RabbitAdmin` instances (assuming they have `auto-startup="true"`) in the application context.

Starting with version 2.1.9, the `RabbitAdmin` has a new property `explicitDeclarationsOnly` (which is `false` by default); when this is set to `true`, the admin will only declare beans that are explicitly configured to be declared by that admin.

NOTE: Starting with the 1.2 release, you can conditionally declare these elements.
This is particularly useful when an application connects to multiple brokers and needs to specify with which brokers a particular element should be declared.

The classes representing these elements implement `Declarable`, which has two methods: `shouldDeclare()` and `getDeclaringAdmins()`.
The `RabbitAdmin` uses these methods to determine whether a particular instance should actually process the declarations on its `Connection`.

The properties are available as attributes in the namespace, as shown in the following examples:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:admin id="admin1" connection-factory="CF1" />

<rabbit:admin id="admin2" connection-factory="CF2" />

<rabbit:admin id="admin3" connection-factory="CF3" explicit-declarations-only="true" />

<rabbit:queue id="declaredByAdmin1AndAdmin2Implicitly" />

<rabbit:queue id="declaredByAdmin1AndAdmin2" declared-by="admin1, admin2" />

<rabbit:queue id="declaredByAdmin1Only" declared-by="admin1" />

<rabbit:queue id="notDeclaredByAllExceptAdmin3" auto-declare="false" />

<rabbit:direct-exchange name="direct" declared-by="admin1, admin2">
    <rabbit:bindings>
        <rabbit:binding key="foo" queue="bar"/>
    </rabbit:bindings>
</rabbit:direct-exchange>
----

NOTE: By default, the `auto-declare` attribute is `true` and, if the `declared-by` is not supplied (or is empty), then all `RabbitAdmin` instances declare the object (as long as the admin's `auto-startup` attribute is `true`, the default, and the admin's `explicit-declarations-only` attribute is false).

Similarly, you can use Java-based `@Configuration` to achieve the same effect.
In the following example, the components are declared by `admin1` but not by `admin2`:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public RabbitAdmin admin1() {
    return new RabbitAdmin(cf1());
}

@Bean
public RabbitAdmin admin2() {
    return new RabbitAdmin(cf2());
}

@Bean
public Queue queue() {
    Queue queue = new Queue("foo");
    queue.setAdminsThatShouldDeclare(admin1());
    return queue;
}

@Bean
public Exchange exchange() {
    DirectExchange exchange = new DirectExchange("bar");
    exchange.setAdminsThatShouldDeclare(admin1());
    return exchange;
}

@Bean
public Binding binding() {
    Binding binding = new Binding("foo", DestinationType.QUEUE, exchange().getName(), "foo", null);
    binding.setAdminsThatShouldDeclare(admin1());
    return binding;
}
----

[[note-id-name]]
== A Note On the `id` and `name` Attributes

The `name` attribute on `<rabbit:queue/>` and `<rabbit:exchange/>` elements reflects the name of the entity in the broker.
For queues, if the `name` is omitted, an anonymous queue is created (see xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#anonymous-queue[`AnonymousQueue`]).

In versions prior to 2.0, the `name` was also registered as a bean name alias (similar to `name` on `<bean/>` elements).

This caused two problems:

* It prevented the declaration of a queue and exchange with the same name.
* The alias was not resolved if it contained a SpEL expression (`#{...}`).

Starting with version 2.0, if you declare one of these elements with both an `id` _and_ a `name` attribute, the name is no longer declared as a bean name alias.
If you wish to declare a queue and exchange with the same `name`, you must provide an `id`.

There is no change if the element has only a `name` attribute.
The bean can still be referenced by the `name` -- for example, in binding declarations.
However, you still cannot reference it if the name contains SpEL -- you must provide an `id` for reference purposes.


[[anonymous-queue]]
== `AnonymousQueue`

In general, when you need a uniquely-named, exclusive, auto-delete queue, we recommend that you use the `AnonymousQueue`
instead of broker-defined queue names (using `""` as a `Queue` name causes the broker to generate the queue
name).

This is because:

. The queues are actually declared when the connection to the broker is established.
This is long after the beans are created and wired together.
Beans that use the queue need to know its name.
In fact, the broker might not even be running when the application is started.
. If the connection to the broker is lost for some reason, the admin re-declares the `AnonymousQueue` with the same name.
If we used broker-declared queues, the queue name would change.

You can control the format of the queue name used by `AnonymousQueue` instances.

By default, the queue name is prefixed by `spring.gen-` followed by a base64 representation of the `UUID` -- for example: `spring.gen-MRBv9sqISkuCiPfOYfpo4g`.

You can provide an `AnonymousQueue.NamingStrategy` implementation in a constructor argument.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Queue anon1() {
    return new AnonymousQueue();
}

@Bean
public Queue anon2() {
    return new AnonymousQueue(new AnonymousQueue.Base64UrlNamingStrategy("something-"));
}

@Bean
public Queue anon3() {
    return new AnonymousQueue(AnonymousQueue.UUIDNamingStrategy.DEFAULT);
}
----

The first bean generates a queue name prefixed by `spring.gen-` followed by a base64 representation of the `UUID` -- for
example: `spring.gen-MRBv9sqISkuCiPfOYfpo4g`.
The second bean generates a queue name prefixed by `something-` followed by a base64 representation of the `UUID`.
The third bean generates a name by using only the UUID (no base64 conversion) -- for example, `f20c818a-006b-4416-bf91-643590fedb0e`.

The base64 encoding uses the "`URL and Filename Safe Alphabet`" from RFC 4648.
Trailing padding characters (`=`) are removed.

You can provide your own naming strategy, whereby you can include other information (such as the application name or client host) in the queue name.

You can specify the naming strategy when you use XML configuration.
The `naming-strategy` attribute is present on the `<rabbit:queue>` element
for a bean reference that implements `AnonymousQueue.NamingStrategy`.
The following examples show how to specify the naming strategy in various ways:

[source, xml]
----
<rabbit:queue id="uuidAnon" />

<rabbit:queue id="springAnon" naming-strategy="uuidNamer" />

<rabbit:queue id="customAnon" naming-strategy="customNamer" />

<bean id="uuidNamer" class="org.springframework.amqp.core.AnonymousQueue.UUIDNamingStrategy" />

<bean id="customNamer" class="org.springframework.amqp.core.AnonymousQueue.Base64UrlNamingStrategy">
    <constructor-arg value="custom.gen-" />
</bean>
----

The first example creates names such as `spring.gen-MRBv9sqISkuCiPfOYfpo4g`.
The second example creates names with a String representation of a UUID.
The third example creates names such as `custom.gen-MRBv9sqISkuCiPfOYfpo4g`.

You can also provide your own naming strategy bean.

Starting with version 2.1, anonymous queues are declared with argument `Queue.X_QUEUE_LEADER_LOCATOR` set to `client-local` by default.
This ensures that the queue is declared on the node to which the application is connected.
You can revert to the previous behavior by calling `queue.setLeaderLocator(null)` after constructing the instance.

[[declarable-recovery]]
== Recovering Auto-Delete Declarations

Normally, the `RabbitAdmin` (s) only recover queues/exchanges/bindings that are declared as beans in the application context; if any such declarations are auto-delete, they will be removed by the broker if the connection is lost.
When the connection is re-established, the admin will redeclare the entities.
Normally, entities created by calling `admin.declareQueue(...)`, `admin.declareExchange(...)` and `admin.declareBinding(...)` will not be recovered.

Starting with version 2.4, the admin has a new property `redeclareManualDeclarations`; when `true`, the admin will recover these entities in addition to the beans in the application context.

Recovery of individual declarations will not be performed if `deleteQueue(...)`, `deleteExchange(...)` or `removeBinding(...)` is called.
Associated bindings are removed from the recoverable entities when queues and exchanges are deleted.

Finally, calling `resetAllManualDeclarations()` will prevent the recovery of any previously declared entities.
