[[sending-messages]]
= Sending Messages

When sending a message, you can use any of the following methods:

[source,java]
----
void send(Message message) throws AmqpException;

void send(String routingKey, Message message) throws AmqpException;

void send(String exchange, String routingKey, Message message) throws AmqpException;
----

We can begin our discussion with the last method in the preceding listing, since it is actually the most explicit.
It lets an AMQP exchange name  (along with a routing key) be provided at runtime.
The last parameter is the callback that is responsible for actual creating the message instance.
An example of using this method to send a message might look like this:
The following example shows how to use the `send` method to send a message:

[source,java]
----
amqpTemplate.send("marketData.topic", "quotes.nasdaq.THING1",
    new Message("12.34".getBytes(), someProperties));
----

You can set the `exchange` property on the template itself if you plan to use that template instance to send to the same exchange most or all of the time.
In such cases, you can use the second method in the preceding listing.
The following example is functionally equivalent to the previous example:

[source,java]
----
amqpTemplate.setExchange("marketData.topic");
amqpTemplate.send("quotes.nasdaq.FOO", new Message("12.34".getBytes(), someProperties));
----

If both the `exchange` and `routingKey` properties are set on the template, you can use the method that accepts only the `Message`.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
amqpTemplate.setExchange("marketData.topic");
amqpTemplate.setRoutingKey("quotes.nasdaq.FOO");
amqpTemplate.send(new Message("12.34".getBytes(), someProperties));
----

A better way of thinking about the exchange and routing key properties is that the explicit method parameters always override the template's default values.
In fact, even if you do not explicitly set those properties on the template, there are always default values in place.
In both cases, the default is an empty `String`, but that is actually a sensible default.
As far as the routing key is concerned, it is not always necessary in the first place (for example, for
a `Fanout` exchange).
Furthermore, a queue may be bound to an exchange with an empty `String`.
Those are both legitimate scenarios for reliance on the default empty `String` value for the routing key property of the template.
As far as the exchange name is concerned, the empty `String` is commonly used because the AMQP specification defines the "`default exchange`" as having no name.
Since all queues are automatically bound to that default exchange (which is a direct exchange), using their name as the binding value, the second method in the preceding listing can be used for simple point-to-point messaging to any queue through the default exchange.
You can provide the queue name as the `routingKey`, either by providing the method parameter at runtime.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
RabbitTemplate template = new RabbitTemplate(); // using default no-name Exchange
template.send("queue.helloWorld", new Message("Hello World".getBytes(), someProperties));
----

Alternately, you can create a template that can be used for publishing primarily or exclusively to a single Queue.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
RabbitTemplate template = new RabbitTemplate(); // using default no-name Exchange
template.setRoutingKey("queue.helloWorld"); // but we'll always send to this Queue
template.send(new Message("Hello World".getBytes(), someProperties));
----

[[message-builder]]
== Message Builder API

Starting with version 1.3, a message builder API is provided by the `MessageBuilder` and `MessagePropertiesBuilder`.
These methods provide a convenient "`fluent`" means of creating a message or message properties.
The following examples show the fluent API in action:

[source,java]
----
Message message = MessageBuilder.withBody("foo".getBytes())
    .setContentType(MessageProperties.CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_PLAIN)
    .setMessageId("123")
    .setHeader("bar", "baz")
    .build();
----

[source,java]
----
MessageProperties props = MessagePropertiesBuilder.newInstance()
    .setContentType(MessageProperties.CONTENT_TYPE_TEXT_PLAIN)
    .setMessageId("123")
    .setHeader("bar", "baz")
    .build();
Message message = MessageBuilder.withBody("foo".getBytes())
    .andProperties(props)
    .build();
----

Each of the properties defined on the {spring-amqp-java-docs}/core/MessageProperties.html[`MessageProperties`] can be set.
Other methods include `setHeader(String key, String value)`, `removeHeader(String key)`, `removeHeaders()`, and `copyProperties(MessageProperties properties)`.
Each property setting method has a `set*IfAbsent()` variant.
In the cases where a default initial value exists, the method is named `set*IfAbsentOrDefault()`.

Five static methods are provided to create an initial message builder:

[source,java]
----
public static MessageBuilder withBody(byte[] body) <1>

public static MessageBuilder withClonedBody(byte[] body) <2>

public static MessageBuilder withBody(byte[] body, int from, int to) <3>

public static MessageBuilder fromMessage(Message message) <4>

public static MessageBuilder fromClonedMessage(Message message) <5>
----

<1> The message created by the builder has a body that is a direct reference to the argument.
<2> The message created by the builder has a body that is a new array containing a copy of bytes in the argument.
<3>    The message created by the builder has a body that is a new array containing the range of bytes from the argument.
See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html[`Arrays.copyOfRange()`] for more details.
<4> The message created by the builder has a body that is a direct reference to the body of the argument.
The argument's properties are copied to a new `MessageProperties`  object.
<5> The message created by the builder has a body that is a new array containing a copy of the argument's body.
The argument's properties are copied to a new `MessageProperties`  object.

Three static methods are provided to create a `MessagePropertiesBuilder` instance:

[source,java]
----
public static MessagePropertiesBuilder newInstance() <1>

public static MessagePropertiesBuilder fromProperties(MessageProperties properties) <2>

public static MessagePropertiesBuilder fromClonedProperties(MessageProperties properties) <3>
----

<1> A new message properties object is initialized with default values.
<2> The builder is initialized with, and `build()` will return, the provided properties object.,
<3> The argument's properties are copied to a new `MessageProperties` object.

With the `RabbitTemplate` implementation of `AmqpTemplate`, each of the `send()` methods has an overloaded version that takes an additional `CorrelationData` object.
When publisher confirms are enabled, this object is returned in the callback described in xref:amqp/template.adoc[`AmqpTemplate`].
This lets the sender correlate a confirm (`ack` or `nack`) with the sent message.

Starting with version 1.6.7, the `CorrelationAwareMessagePostProcessor` interface was introduced, allowing the correlation data to be modified after the message has been converted.
The following example shows how to use it:

[source, java]
----
Message postProcessMessage(Message message, Correlation correlation);
----

In version 2.0, this interface is deprecated.
The method has been moved to `MessagePostProcessor` with a default implementation that delegates to `postProcessMessage(Message message)`.

Also starting with version 1.6.7, a new callback interface called `CorrelationDataPostProcessor` is provided.
This is invoked after all `MessagePostProcessor` instances (provided in the `send()` method as well as those provided in `setBeforePublishPostProcessors()`).
Implementations can update or replace the correlation data supplied in the `send()` method (if any).
The `Message` and original `CorrelationData` (if any) are provided as arguments.
The following example shows how to use the `postProcess` method:

[source, java]
----
CorrelationData postProcess(Message message, CorrelationData correlationData);
----

[[publisher-returns]]
== Publisher Returns

When the template's `mandatory` property is `true`, returned messages are provided by the callback described in xref:amqp/template.adoc[`AmqpTemplate`].

Starting with version 1.4, the `RabbitTemplate` supports the SpEL `mandatoryExpression` property, which is evaluated against each request message as the root evaluation object, resolving to a `boolean` value.
Bean references, such as `@myBean.isMandatory(#root)`, can be used in the expression.

Publisher returns can also be used internally by the `RabbitTemplate` in send and receive operations.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#reply-timeout[Reply Timeout] for more information.

[[template-batching]]
== Batching

Version 1.4.2 introduced the `BatchingRabbitTemplate`.
This is a subclass of `RabbitTemplate` with an overridden `send` method that batches messages according to the `BatchingStrategy`.
Only when a batch is complete is the message sent to RabbitMQ.
The following listing shows the `BatchingStrategy` interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface BatchingStrategy {

    MessageBatch addToBatch(String exchange, String routingKey, Message message);

    Date nextRelease();

    Collection<MessageBatch> releaseBatches();

}
----

CAUTION: Batched data is held in memory.
Unsent messages can be lost in the event of a system failure.

A `SimpleBatchingStrategy` is provided.
It supports sending messages to a single exchange or routing key.
It has the following properties:

* `batchSize`: The number of messages in a batch before it is sent.
* `bufferLimit`: The maximum size of the batched message.
This preempts the `batchSize`, if exceeded, and causes a partial batch to be sent.
* `timeout`: A time after which a partial batch is sent when there is no new activity adding messages to the batch.

The `SimpleBatchingStrategy` formats the batch by preceding each embedded message with a four-byte binary length.
This is communicated to the receiving system by setting the `springBatchFormat` message property to `lengthHeader4`.

IMPORTANT: Batched messages are automatically de-batched by listener containers by default (by using the `springBatchFormat` message header).
Rejecting any message from a batch causes the entire batch to be rejected.

However, see xref:amqp/receiving-messages/batch.adoc[@RabbitListener with Batching] for more information.
