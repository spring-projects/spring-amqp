Spring AMQP provides extensive logging, especially at the `DEBUG` level.

If you wish to monitor the AMQP protocol between the application and broker, you can use a tool such as WireShark, which has a plugin to decode the protocol.
Alternatively, the RabbitMQ Java client comes with a very useful class called `Tracer`.
When run as a `main`, by default, it listens on port 5673 and connects to port 5672 on localhost.
You can run it and change your connection factory configuration to connect to port 5673 on localhost.
It displays the decoded protocol on the console.
Refer to the `Tracer` Javadoc for more information.
