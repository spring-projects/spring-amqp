= Listening to Multiple Queues

When you use the `queues` attribute, you can specify that the associated container can listen to multiple queues.
You can use a `@Header` annotation to make the queue name from which a message was received available to the POJO
method.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
@Component
public class MyService {

    @RabbitListener(queues = { "queue1", "queue2" } )
    public void processOrder(String data, @Header(AmqpHeaders.CONSUMER_QUEUE) String queue) {
        ...
    }

}
----
====

Starting with version 1.5, you can externalize the queue names by using property placeholders and SpEL.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
@Component
public class MyService {

    @RabbitListener(queues = "#{'${property.with.comma.delimited.queue.names}'.split(',')}" )
    public void processOrder(String data, @Header(AmqpHeaders.CONSUMER_QUEUE) String queue) {
        ...
    }

}
----
====

Prior to version 1.5, only a single queue could be specified this way.
Each queue needed a separate property.
