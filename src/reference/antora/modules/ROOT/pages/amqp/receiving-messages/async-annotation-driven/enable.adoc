= Enable Listener Endpoint Annotations

To enable support for `@RabbitListener` annotations, you can add `@EnableRabbit` to one of your `@Configuration` classes.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableRabbit
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory rabbitListenerContainerFactory() {
        SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory factory = new SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory();
        factory.setConnectionFactory(connectionFactory());
        factory.setConcurrentConsumers(3);
        factory.setMaxConcurrentConsumers(10);
        factory.setContainerCustomizer(container -> /* customize the container */);
        return factory;
    }
}
----

Since version 2.0, a `DirectMessageListenerContainerFactory` is also available.
It creates `DirectMessageListenerContainer` instances.

NOTE: For information to help you choose between `SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory` and `DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactory`, see xref:amqp/receiving-messages/choose-container.adoc[Choosing a Container].

Starting with version 2.2.2, you can provide a `ContainerCustomizer` implementation (as shown above).
This can be used to further configure the container after it has been created and configured; you can use this, for example, to set properties that are not exposed by the container factory.

Version 2.4.8 provides the `CompositeContainerCustomizer` for situations where you wish to apply multiple customizers.

By default, the infrastructure looks for a bean named `rabbitListenerContainerFactory` as the source for the factory to use to create message listener containers.
In this case, and ignoring the RabbitMQ infrastructure setup, the `processOrder` method can be invoked with a core poll size of three threads and a maximum pool size of ten threads.

You can customize the listener container factory to use for each annotation, or you can configure an explicit default by implementing the `RabbitListenerConfigurer` interface.
The default is required only if at least one endpoint is registered without a specific container factory.
See the {spring-amqp-java-docs}/rabbit/annotation/RabbitListenerConfigurer.html[Javadoc] for full details and examples.

The container factories provide methods for adding `MessagePostProcessor` instances that are applied after receiving messages (before invoking the listener) and before sending replies.

See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/reply.adoc[Reply Management] for information about replies.

Starting with version 2.0.6, you can add a `RetryTemplate` and `RecoveryCallback` to the listener container factory.
It is used when sending replies.
The `RecoveryCallback` is invoked when retries are exhausted.
You can use a `SendRetryContextAccessor` to get information from the context.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
factory.setRetryTemplate(retryTemplate);
factory.setReplyRecoveryCallback(ctx -> {
    Message failed = SendRetryContextAccessor.getMessage(ctx);
    Address replyTo = SendRetryContextAccessor.getAddress(ctx);
    Throwable t = ctx.getLastThrowable();
    ...
    return null;
});
----

If you prefer XML configuration, you can use the `<rabbit:annotation-driven>` element.
Any beans annotated with `@RabbitListener` are detected.

For `SimpleRabbitListenerContainer` instances, you can use XML similar to the following:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:annotation-driven/>

<bean id="rabbitListenerContainerFactory"
      class="org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.config.SimpleRabbitListenerContainerFactory">
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="connectionFactory"/>
    <property name="concurrentConsumers" value="3"/>
    <property name="maxConcurrentConsumers" value="10"/>
</bean>
----

For `DirectMessageListenerContainer` instances, you can use XML similar to the following:

[source,xml]
----
<rabbit:annotation-driven/>

<bean id="rabbitListenerContainerFactory"
      class="org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.config.DirectRabbitListenerContainerFactory">
    <property name="connectionFactory" ref="connectionFactory"/>
    <property name="consumersPerQueue" value="3"/>
</bean>
----


[[listener-property-overrides]]
Starting with version 2.0, the `@RabbitListener` annotation has a `concurrency` property.
It supports SpEL expressions (`#{...}`) and property placeholders (`${...}`).
Its meaning and allowed values depend on the container type, as follows:

* For the `DirectMessageListenerContainer`, the value must be a single integer value, which sets the `consumersPerQueue` property on the container.
* For the `SimpleRabbitListenerContainer`, the value can be a single integer value, which sets the `concurrentConsumers` property on the container, or it can have the form, `m-n`, where `m` is the `concurrentConsumers` property and `n` is the `maxConcurrentConsumers` property.

In either case, this setting overrides the settings on the factory.
Previously you had to define different container factories if you had listeners that required different concurrency.

The annotation also allows overriding the factory `autoStartup` and `taskExecutor` properties via the `autoStartup` and `executor` (since 2.2) annotation properties.
Using a different executor for each might help with identifying threads associated with each listener in logs and thread dumps.

Version 2.2 also added the `ackMode` property, which allows you to override the container factory's `acknowledgeMode` property.

[source, java]
----
@RabbitListener(id = "manual.acks.1", queues = "manual.acks.1", ackMode = "MANUAL")
public void manual1(String in, Channel channel,
    @Header(AmqpHeaders.DELIVERY_TAG) long tag) throws IOException {

    ...
    channel.basicAck(tag, false);
}
