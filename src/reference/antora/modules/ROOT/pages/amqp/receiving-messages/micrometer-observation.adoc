Using Micrometer for observation is now supported, since version 3.0, for the `RabbitTemplate` and listener containers.

Set `observationEnabled` on each component to enable observation; this will disable xref:amqp/receiving-messages/micrometer.adoc[Micrometer Timers] because the timers will now be managed with each observation.
When using annotated listeners, set `observationEnabled` on the container factory.

Refer to https://micrometer.io/docs/tracing[Micrometer Tracing] for more information.

To add tags to timers/traces, configure a custom `RabbitTemplateObservationConvention` or `RabbitListenerObservationConvention` to the template or listener container, respectively.

The default implementations add the `name` tag for template observations and `listener.id` tag for containers.

You can either subclass `DefaultRabbitTemplateObservationConvention` or `DefaultRabbitListenerObservationConvention` or provide completely new implementations.

See xref:appendix/micrometer.adoc[Micrometer Observation Documentation] for more details.

WARNING: Due to ambiguity in how traces should be handled in a batch, observations are *NOT* created for xref:amqp/receiving-messages/batch.adoc[Batch Listener Containers].
