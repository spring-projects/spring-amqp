[[changes-in-1-5-since-1-4]]
= Changes in 1.5 Since 1.4

[[spring-erlang-is-no-longer-supported]]
== `spring-erlang` Is No Longer Supported

The `spring-erlang` jar is no longer included in the distribution.
Use xref:amqp/management-rest-api.adoc#management-rest-api[RabbitMQ REST API] instead.

[[cachingconnectionfactory-changes]]
== `CachingConnectionFactory` Changes

[[empty-addresses-property-in-cachingconnectionfactory]]
=== Empty Addresses Property in `CachingConnectionFactory`

Previously, if the connection factory was configured with a host and port but an empty String was also supplied for
`addresses`, the host and port were ignored.
Now, an empty `addresses` String is treated the same as a `null`, and the host and port are used.

[[uri-constructor]]
=== URI Constructor

The `CachingConnectionFactory` has an additional constructor, with a `URI` parameter, to configure the broker connection.

[[connection-reset]]
=== Connection Reset

A new method called `resetConnection()` has been added to let users reset the connection (or connections).
You might use this, for example, to reconnect to the primary broker after failing over to the secondary broker.
This *does* impact in-process operations.
The existing `destroy()` method does exactly the same, but the new method has a less daunting name.

[[properties-to-control-container-queue-declaration-behavior]]
== Properties to Control Container Queue Declaration Behavior

When the listener container consumers start, they attempt to passively declare the queues to ensure they are available
on the broker.
Previously, if these declarations failed (for example, because the queues didn't exist) or when an HA queue was being
moved, the retry logic was fixed at three retry attempts at five-second intervals.
If the queues still do not exist, the behavior is controlled by the `missingQueuesFatal` property (default: `true`).
Also, for containers configured to listen from multiple queues, if only a subset of queues are available, the consumer
retried the missing queues on a fixed interval of 60 seconds.

The `declarationRetries`, `failedDeclarationRetryInterval`, and `retryDeclarationInterval` properties are now configurable.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] for more information.

[[class-package-change]]
== Class Package Change

The `RabbitGatewaySupport` class has been moved from `o.s.amqp.rabbit.core.support` to `o.s.amqp.rabbit.core`.

[[defaultmessagepropertiesconverter-changes]]
== `DefaultMessagePropertiesConverter` Changes

You can now configure the `DefaultMessagePropertiesConverter` to
determine the maximum length of a `LongString` that is converted
to a `String` rather than to a `DataInputStream`.
The converter has an alternative constructor that takes the value as a limit.
Previously, this limit was hard-coded at `1024` bytes.
(Also available in 1.4.4).

[[rabbitlistener-improvements]]
== `@RabbitListener` Improvements

[[queuebinding-for-rabbitlistener]]
=== `@QueueBinding` for `@RabbitListener`

The `bindings` attribute has been added to the `@RabbitListener` annotation as mutually exclusive with the `queues`
attribute to allow the specification of the `queue`, its `exchange`, and `binding` for declaration by a `RabbitAdmin` on
the Broker.

[[spel-in-sendto]]
=== SpEL in `@SendTo`

The default reply address (`@SendTo`) for a `@RabbitListener` can now be a SpEL expression.

[[multiple-queue-names-through-properties]]
=== Multiple Queue Names through Properties

You can now use a combination of SpEL and property placeholders to specify multiple queues for a listener.

See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

[[automatic-exchange-queue-and-binding-declaration]]
== Automatic Exchange, Queue, and Binding Declaration

You can now declare beans that define a collection of these entities, and the `RabbitAdmin` adds the
contents to the list of entities that it declares when a connection is established.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#collection-declaration[Declaring Collections of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings] for more information.

[[rabbittemplate-changes]]
== `RabbitTemplate` Changes

[[reply-address-added]]
=== `reply-address` Added

The `reply-address` attribute has been added to the `<rabbit-template>` component as an alternative `reply-queue`.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc[Request/Reply Messaging] for more information.
(Also available in 1.4.4 as a setter on the `RabbitTemplate`).

[[blocking-receive-methods]]
=== Blocking `receive` Methods

The `RabbitTemplate` now supports blocking in `receive` and `convertAndReceive` methods.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/polling-consumer.adoc[Polling Consumer] for more information.

[[mandatory-with-sendandreceive-methods]]
=== Mandatory with `sendAndReceive` Methods

When the `mandatory` flag is set when using the `sendAndReceive` and `convertSendAndReceive` methods, the calling thread
throws an `AmqpMessageReturnedException` if the request message cannot be delivered.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#reply-timeout[Reply Timeout] for more information.

[[improper-reply-listener-configuration]]
=== Improper Reply Listener Configuration

The framework tries to verify proper configuration of a reply listener container when using a named reply queue.

See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#reply-listener[Reply Listener Container] for more information.

[[rabbitmanagementtemplate-added]]
== `RabbitManagementTemplate` Added

The `RabbitManagementTemplate` has been introduced to monitor and configure the RabbitMQ Broker by using the REST API provided by its https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html[management plugin].
See xref:amqp/management-rest-api.adoc#management-rest-api[RabbitMQ REST API] for more information.

[[listener-container-bean-names-xml]]
== Listener Container Bean Names (XML)

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `id` attribute on the `<listener-container/>` element has been removed.
Starting with this release, the `id` on the `<listener/>` child element is used alone to name the listener container bean created for each listener element.

Normal Spring bean name overrides are applied.
If a later `<listener/>` is parsed with the same `id` as an existing bean, the new definition overrides the existing one.
Previously, bean names were composed from the `id` attributes of the `<listener-container/>` and `<listener/>` elements.

When migrating to this release, if you have `id` attributes on your `<listener-container/>` elements, remove them and set the `id` on the child `<listener/>` element instead.
====

However, to support starting and stopping containers as a group, a new `group` attribute has been added.
When this attribute is defined, the containers created by this element are added to a bean with this name, of type `Collection<SimpleMessageListenerContainer>`.
You can iterate over this group to start and stop containers.

[[class-level-rabbitlistener]]
== Class-Level `@RabbitListener`

The `@RabbitListener` annotation can now be applied at the class level.
Together with the new `@RabbitHandler` method annotation, this lets you select the handler method based on payload type.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/method-selection.adoc[Multi-method Listeners] for more information.

[[simplemessagelistenercontainer:-backoff-support]]
== `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`: BackOff Support

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` can now be supplied with a `BackOff` instance for `consumer` startup recovery.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] for more information.

[[channel-close-logging]]
== Channel Close Logging

A mechanism to control the log levels of channel closure has been introduced.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#channel-close-logging[Logging Channel Close Events].

[[application-events]]
== Application Events

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` now emits application events when consumers fail.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/consumer-events.adoc[Consumer Events] for more information.

[[consumer-tag-configuration]]
== Consumer Tag Configuration

Previously, the consumer tags for asynchronous consumers were generated by the broker.
With this release, it is now possible to supply a naming strategy to the listener container.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/consumerTags.adoc[Consumer Tags].

[[using-messagelisteneradapter]]
== Using `MessageListenerAdapter`

The `MessageListenerAdapter` now supports a map of queue names (or consumer tags) to method names, to determine
which delegate method to call based on the queue from which the message was received.

[[localizedqueueconnectionfactory-added]]
== `LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory` Added

`LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory` is a new connection factory that connects to the node in a cluster where a mirrored queue actually resides.

See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#queue-affinity[Queue Affinity and the `LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory`].

[[anonymous-queue-naming]]
== Anonymous Queue Naming

Starting with version 1.5.3, you can now control how `AnonymousQueue` names are generated.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#anonymous-queue[`AnonymousQueue`] for more information.
