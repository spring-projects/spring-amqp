= Changes to 1.2 Since 1.1

[[rabbitmq-version]]
== RabbitMQ Version

Spring AMQP now uses RabbitMQ 3.1.x by default (but retains compatibility with earlier versions).
Certain deprecations have been added for features no longer supported by RabbitMQ 3.1.x -- federated exchanges and the `immediate` property on the `RabbitTemplate`.

[[rabbit-admin]]
== Rabbit Admin

`RabbitAdmin` now provides an option to let exchange, queue, and binding declarations continue when a declaration fails.
Previously, all declarations stopped on a failure.
By setting `ignore-declaration-exceptions`, such exceptions are logged (at the `WARN` level), but further declarations continue.
An example where this might be useful is when a queue declaration fails because of a slightly different `ttl` setting that would normally stop other declarations from proceeding.

`RabbitAdmin` now provides an additional method called `getQueueProperties()`.
You can use this determine if a queue exists on the broker (returns `null` for a non-existent queue).
In addition, it returns the current number of messages in the queue as well as the current number of consumers.

[[rabbit-template]]
== Rabbit Template

Previously, when the `...sendAndReceive()` methods were used with a fixed reply queue, two custom headers were used for correlation data and to retain and restore reply queue information.
With this release, the standard message property (`correlationId`) is used by default, although you can specify a custom property to use instead.
In addition, nested `replyTo` information is now retained internally in the template, instead of using a custom header.

The `immediate` property is deprecated.
You must not set this property when using RabbitMQ 3.0.x or greater.

[[json-message-converters]]
== JSON Message Converters

A Jackson 2.x `MessageConverter` is now provided, along with the existing converter that uses Jackson 1.x.

[[automatic-declaration-of-queues-and-other-items]]
== Automatic Declaration of Queues and Other Items

Previously, when declaring queues, exchanges and bindings, you could not define which connection factory was used for the declarations.
Each `RabbitAdmin` declared all components by using its connection.

Starting with this release, you can now limit declarations to specific `RabbitAdmin` instances.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#conditional-declaration[Conditional Declaration].

[[amqp-remoting]]
== AMQP Remoting

Facilities are now provided for using Spring remoting techniques, using AMQP as the transport for the RPC calls.
For more information see xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#remoting[Spring Remoting with AMQP].

[[requested-heart-beats]]
== Requested Heart Beats

Several users have asked for the underlying client connection factory's `requestedHeartBeats` property to be exposed on the Spring AMQP `CachingConnectionFactory`.
This is now available.
Previously, it was necessary to configure the AMQP client factory as a separate bean and provide a reference to it in the `CachingConnectionFactory`.
