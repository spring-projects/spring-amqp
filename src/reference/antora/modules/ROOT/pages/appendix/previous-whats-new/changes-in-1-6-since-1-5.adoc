[[changes-in-1-6-since-1-5]]
= Changes in 1.6 Since 1.5

[[testing-support]]
== Testing Support

A new testing support library is now provided.
See xref:testing.adoc[Testing Support] for more information.

[[builder]]
== Builder

Builders that provide a fluent API for configuring `Queue` and `Exchange` objects are now available.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#builder-api[Builder API for Queues and Exchanges] for more information.

[[namespace-changes]]
== Namespace Changes

[[connection-factory]]
=== Connection Factory

You can now add a `thread-factory` to a connection factory bean declaration -- for example, to name the threads
created by the `amqp-client` library.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management] for more information.

When you use `CacheMode.CONNECTION`, you can now limit the total number of connections allowed.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management] for more information.

[[queue-definitions]]
=== Queue Definitions

You can now provide a naming strategy for anonymous queues.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#anonymous-queue[`AnonymousQueue`] for more information.

[[listener-container-changes]]
== Listener Container Changes

[[idle-message-listener-detection]]
=== Idle Message Listener Detection

You can now configure listener containers to publish `ApplicationEvent` instances when idle.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/idle-containers.adoc[Detecting Idle Asynchronous Consumers] for more information.

[[mismatched-queue-detection]]
=== Mismatched Queue Detection

By default, when a listener container starts, if queues with mismatched properties or arguments are detected,
the container logs the exception but continues to listen.
The container now has a property called `mismatchedQueuesFatal`, which prevents the container (and context) from
starting if the problem is detected during startup.
It also stops the container if the problem is detected later, such as after recovering from a connection failure.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] for more information.

[[listener-container-logging]]
=== Listener Container Logging

Now, listener container provides its `beanName` to the internal `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` as a `threadNamePrefix`.
It is useful for logs analysis.

[[default-error-handler]]
=== Default Error Handler

The default error handler (`ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler`) now considers irrecoverable `@RabbitListener`
exceptions as fatal.
See xref:amqp/exception-handling.adoc[Exception Handling] for more information.


[[autodeclare-and-rabbitadmin-instances]]
== `AutoDeclare` and `RabbitAdmin` Instances

See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] (`autoDeclare`) for some changes to the semantics of that option with respect to the use
of `RabbitAdmin` instances in the application context.

[[amqptemplate:-receive-with-timeout]]
== `AmqpTemplate`: Receive with Timeout

A number of new `receive()` methods with `timeout` have been introduced for the `AmqpTemplate`
and its `RabbitTemplate` implementation.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/polling-consumer.adoc[Polling Consumer] for more information.

[[using-asyncrabbittemplate]]
== Using `AsyncRabbitTemplate`

A new `AsyncRabbitTemplate` has been introduced.
This template provides a number of send and receive methods, where the return value is a `ListenableFuture`, which can
be used later to obtain the result either synchronously or asynchronously.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#async-template[Async Rabbit Template] for more information.

[[rabbittemplate-changes]]
== `RabbitTemplate` Changes

1.4.1 introduced the ability to use https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html[direct reply-to] when the broker supports it.
It is more efficient than using a temporary queue for each reply.
This version lets you override this default behavior and use a temporary queue by setting the `useTemporaryReplyQueues` property to `true`.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#direct-reply-to[RabbitMQ Direct reply-to] for more information.

The `RabbitTemplate` now supports a `user-id-expression` (`userIdExpression` when using Java configuration).
See https://www.rabbitmq.com/validated-user-id.html[Validated User-ID RabbitMQ documentation] and xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-user-id[Validated User Id] for more information.

[[message-properties]]
== Message Properties

[[using-correlationid]]
=== Using `CorrelationId`

The `correlationId` message property can now be a `String`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#message-properties-converters[Message Properties Converters] for more information.

[[long-string-headers]]
=== Long String Headers

Previously, the `DefaultMessagePropertiesConverter` "`converted`" headers longer than the long string limit (default 1024)
to a `DataInputStream` (actually, it referenced the `LongString` instance's `DataInputStream`).
On output, this header was not converted (except to a String -- for example, `java.io.DataInputStream@1d057a39` by calling
`toString()` on the stream).

With this release, long `LongString` instances are now left as `LongString` instances by default.
You can access the contents by using the `getBytes[]`, `toString()`, or `getStream()` methods.
A large incoming `LongString` is now correctly "`converted`" on output too.

See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#message-properties-converters[Message Properties Converters] for more information.

[[inbound-delivery-mode]]
=== Inbound Delivery Mode

The `deliveryMode` property is no longer mapped to the `MessageProperties.deliveryMode`.
This change avoids unintended propagation if the the same `MessageProperties` object is used to send an outbound message.
Instead, the inbound `deliveryMode` header is mapped to `MessageProperties.receivedDeliveryMode`.

See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#message-properties-converters[Message Properties Converters] for more information.

When using annotated endpoints, the header is provided in the header named `AmqpHeaders.RECEIVED_DELIVERY_MODE`.

See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/enable-signature.adoc[Annotated Endpoint Method Signature] for more information.

[[inbound-user-id]]
=== Inbound User ID

The `user_id` property is no longer mapped to the `MessageProperties.userId`.
This change avoids unintended propagation if the the same `MessageProperties` object is used to send an outbound message.
Instead, the inbound `userId` header is mapped to `MessageProperties.receivedUserId`.

See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#message-properties-converters[Message Properties Converters] for more information.

When you use annotated endpoints, the header is provided in the header named `AmqpHeaders.RECEIVED_USER_ID`.

See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/enable-signature.adoc[Annotated Endpoint Method Signature] for more information.

[[rabbitadmin-changes]]
== `RabbitAdmin` Changes

[[declaration-failures]]
=== Declaration Failures

Previously, the `ignoreDeclarationFailures` flag took effect only for `IOException` on the channel (such as mis-matched
arguments).
It now takes effect for any exception (such as `TimeoutException`).
In addition, a `DeclarationExceptionEvent` is now published whenever a declaration fails.
The `RabbitAdmin` last declaration event is also available as a property `lastDeclarationExceptionEvent`.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc[Configuring the Broker] for more information.

[[rabbitlistener-changes]]
== `@RabbitListener` Changes

[[multiple-containers-for-each-bean]]
=== Multiple Containers for Each Bean

When you use Java 8 or later, you can now add multiple `@RabbitListener` annotations to `@Bean` classes or
their methods.
When using Java 7 or earlier, you can use the `@RabbitListeners` container annotation to provide the same
functionality.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/repeatable-rabbit-listener.adoc[`@Repeatable` `@RabbitListener`] for more information.

[[sendto-spel-expressions]]
=== `@SendTo` SpEL Expressions

`@SendTo` for routing replies with no `replyTo` property can now be SpEL expressions evaluated against the
request/reply.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/reply.adoc[Reply Management] for more information.

[[queuebinding-improvements]]
=== `@QueueBinding` Improvements

You can now specify arguments for queues, exchanges, and bindings in `@QueueBinding` annotations.
Header exchanges are now supported by `@QueueBinding`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

[[delayed-message-exchange]]
== Delayed Message Exchange

Spring AMQP now has first class support for the RabbitMQ Delayed Message Exchange plugin.
See <<delayed-message-exchange>> for more information.

[[exchange-internal-flag]]
== Exchange Internal Flag

Any `Exchange` definitions can now be marked as `internal`, and `RabbitAdmin` passes the value to the broker when
declaring the exchange.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc[Configuring the Broker] for more information.

[[cachingconnectionfactory-changes]]
== `CachingConnectionFactory` Changes

[[cachingconnectionfactory-cache-statistics]]
=== `CachingConnectionFactory` Cache Statistics

The `CachingConnectionFactory` now provides cache properties at runtime and over JMX.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#runtime-cache-properties[Runtime Cache Properties] for more information.

[[accessing-the-underlying-rabbitmq-connection-factory]]
=== Accessing the Underlying RabbitMQ Connection Factory

A new getter has been added to provide access to the underlying factory.
You can use this getter, for example, to add custom connection properties.
See xref:amqp/custom-client-props.adoc[Adding Custom Client Connection Properties] for more information.

[[channel-cache]]
=== Channel Cache

The default channel cache size has been increased from 1 to 25.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management] for more information.

In addition, the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` no longer adjusts the cache size to be at least as large as the number
of `concurrentConsumers` -- this was superfluous, since the container consumer channels are never cached.

[[using-rabbitconnectionfactorybean]]
== Using `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean`

The factory bean now exposes a property to add client connection properties to connections made by the resulting
factory.

[[java-deserialization]]
== Java Deserialization

You can now configure a "`allowed list`" of allowable classes when you use Java deserialization.
You should consider creating an allowed list if you accept messages with serialized java objects from
untrusted sources.
See <<java-deserialization>> for more information.

[[json-messageconverter]]
== JSON `MessageConverter`

Improvements to the JSON message converter now allow the consumption of messages that do not have type information
in message headers.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/conversion.adoc[Message Conversion for Annotated Methods] and xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#json-message-converter[`Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`] for more information.

[[logging-appenders]]
== Logging Appenders

[[log4j-2]]
=== Log4j 2

A log4j 2 appender has been added, and the appenders can now be configured with an `addresses` property to connect
to a broker cluster.

[[client-connection-properties]]
=== Client Connection Properties

You can now add custom client connection properties to RabbitMQ connections.

See xref:logging.adoc[Logging Subsystem AMQP Appenders] for more information.
