[[changes-in-2-1-since-2-0]]
= Changes in 2.1 Since 2.0

[[amqp-client-library]]
== AMQP Client library

Spring AMQP now uses the 5.4.x version of the `amqp-client` library provided by the RabbitMQ team.
This client has auto-recovery configured by default.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#auto-recovery[RabbitMQ Automatic Connection/Topology recovery].

NOTE: As of version 4.0, the client enables automatic recovery by default.
While compatible with this feature, Spring AMQP has its own recovery mechanisms and the client recovery feature generally is not needed.
We recommend disabling `amqp-client` automatic recovery, to avoid getting `AutoRecoverConnectionNotCurrentlyOpenException` instances when the broker is available but the connection has not yet recovered.
Starting with version 1.7.1, Spring AMQP disables it unless you explicitly create your own RabbitMQ connection factory and provide it to the `CachingConnectionFactory`.
RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` instances created by the `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` also have the option disabled by default.


[[package-changes]]
== Package Changes

Certain classes have moved to different packages.
Most are internal classes and do not affect user applications.
Two exceptions are `ChannelAwareMessageListener` and `RabbitListenerErrorHandler`.
These interfaces are now in `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.api`.

[[publisher-confirms-changes]]
== Publisher Confirms Changes

Channels enabled for publisher confirmations are not returned to the cache while there are outstanding confirmations.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-confirms[Correlated Publisher Confirms and Returns] for more information.

[[listener-container-factory-improvements]]
== Listener Container Factory Improvements

You can now use the listener container factories to create any listener container, not only those for use with `@RabbitListener` annotations or the `@RabbitListenerEndpointRegistry`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/using-container-factories.adoc[Using Container Factories] for more information.

`ChannelAwareMessageListener` now inherits from `MessageListener`.

[[broker-event-listener]]
== Broker Event Listener

A `BrokerEventListener` is introduced to publish selected broker events as `ApplicationEvent` instances.
See xref:amqp/broker-events.adoc[Broker Event Listener] for more information.

[[rabbitadmin-changes]]
== RabbitAdmin Changes

The `RabbitAdmin` discovers beans of type `Declarables` (which is a container for `Declarable` - `Queue`, `Exchange`, and `Binding` objects) and declare the contained objects on the broker.
Users are discouraged from using the old mechanism of declaring `<Collection<Queue>>` (and others) and should use `Declarables` beans instead.
By default, the old mechanism is disabled.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#collection-declaration[Declaring Collections of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings] for more information.

`AnonymousQueue` instances are now declared with `x-queue-master-locator` set to `client-local` by default, to ensure the queues are created on the node the application is connected to.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc[Configuring the Broker] for more information.

[[rabbittemplate-changes]]
== RabbitTemplate Changes

You can now configure the `RabbitTemplate` with the `noLocalReplyConsumer` option to control a `noLocal` flag for reply consumers in the `sendAndReceive()` operations.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc[Request/Reply Messaging] for more information.

`CorrelationData` for publisher confirmations now has a `ListenableFuture`, which you can use to get the acknowledgment instead of using a callback.
When returns and confirmations are enabled, the correlation data, if provided, is populated with the returned message.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-confirms[Correlated Publisher Confirms and Returns] for more information.

A method called `replyTimedOut` is now provided to notify subclasses that a reply has timed out, allowing for any state cleanup.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#reply-timeout[Reply Timeout] for more information.

You can now specify an `ErrorHandler` to be invoked when using request/reply with a `DirectReplyToMessageListenerContainer` (the default) when exceptions occur when replies are delivered (for example, late replies).
See `setReplyErrorHandler` on the `RabbitTemplate`.
(Also since 2.0.11).

[[message-conversion]]
== Message Conversion

We introduced a new `Jackson2XmlMessageConverter` to support converting messages from and to XML format.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#jackson2xml[`Jackson2XmlMessageConverter`] for more information.

[[management-rest-api]]
== Management REST API

The `RabbitManagementTemplate` is now deprecated in favor of the direct `com.rabbitmq.http.client.Client` (or `com.rabbitmq.http.client.ReactorNettyClient`) usage.
See xref:amqp/management-rest-api.adoc#management-rest-api[RabbitMQ REST API] for more information.

[[rabbitlistener-changes]]
== `@RabbitListener` Changes

The listener container factory can now be configured with a `RetryTemplate` and, optionally, a `RecoveryCallback` used when sending replies.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/enable.adoc[Enable Listener Endpoint Annotations] for more information.

[[async-rabbitlistener-return]]
== Async `@RabbitListener` Return

`@RabbitListener` methods can now return `ListenableFuture<?>` or `Mono<?>`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-returns.adoc[Asynchronous `@RabbitListener` Return Types] for more information.

[[connection-factory-bean-changes]]
== Connection Factory Bean Changes

By default, the `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` now calls `enableHostnameVerification()`.
To revert to the previous behavior, set the `enableHostnameVerification` property to `false`.

[[connection-factory-changes]]
== Connection Factory Changes

The `CachingConnectionFactory` now unconditionally disables auto-recovery in the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory`, even if a pre-configured instance is provided in a constructor.
While steps have been taken to make Spring AMQP compatible with auto recovery, certain corner cases have arisen where issues remain.
Spring AMQP has had its own recovery mechanism since 1.0.0 and does not need to use the recovery provided by the client.
While it is still possible to enable the feature (using `cachingConnectionFactory.getRabbitConnectionFactory()` `.setAutomaticRecoveryEnabled()`) after the `CachingConnectionFactory` is constructed, **we strongly recommend that you not do so**.
We recommend that you use a separate RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` if you need auto recovery connections when using the client factory directly (rather than using Spring AMQP components).

[[listener-container-changes]]
== Listener Container Changes

The default `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` now completely discards messages that cause fatal errors if an `x-death` header is present.
See xref:amqp/exception-handling.adoc[Exception Handling] for more information.

[[immediate-requeue]]
== Immediate requeue

A new `ImmediateRequeueAmqpException` is introduced to notify a listener container that the message has to be re-queued.
To use this feature, a new `ImmediateRequeueMessageRecoverer` implementation is added.

See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#async-listeners[Message Listeners and the Asynchronous Case] for more information.
