= Changes in 2.2 Since 2.1

This section describes the changes between version 2.1 and version 2.2.

[[package-changes]]
== Package Changes

The following classes/interfaces have been moved from `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.core.support` to `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.batch`:

* `BatchingStrategy`
* `MessageBatch`
* `SimpleBatchingStrategy`

In addition, `ListenerExecutionFailedException` has been moved from `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.listener.exception` to `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.support`.

[[dependency-changes]]
== Dependency Changes

JUnit (4) is now an optional dependency and will no longer appear as a transitive dependency.

The `spring-rabbit-junit` module is now a *compile* dependency in the `spring-rabbit-test` module for a better target application development experience when with only a single `spring-rabbit-test` we get the full stack of testing utilities for AMQP components.

[[-breaking-api-changes]]
== "Breaking" API Changes

the JUnit (5) `RabbitAvailableCondition.getBrokerRunning()` now returns a `BrokerRunningSupport` instance instead of a `BrokerRunning`, which depends on JUnit 4.
It has the same API so it's just a matter of changing the class name of any references.
See xref:testing.adoc#junit5-conditions[JUnit5 Conditions] for more information.

[[listenercontainer-changes]]
== ListenerContainer Changes

Messages with fatal exceptions are now rejected and NOT requeued, by default, even if the acknowledge mode is manual.
See xref:amqp/exception-handling.adoc[Exception Handling] for more information.

Listener performance can now be monitored using Micrometer `Timer` s.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/micrometer.adoc[Monitoring Listener Performance] for more information.

[[rabbitlistener-changes]]
== @RabbitListener Changes

You can now configure an `executor` on each listener, overriding the factory configuration, to more easily identify threads associated with the listener.
You can now override the container factory's `acknowledgeMode` property with the annotation's `ackMode` property.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/enable.adoc#listener-property-overrides[overriding container factory properties] for more information.

When using xref:amqp/receiving-messages/batch.adoc[batching], `@RabbitListener` methods can now receive a complete batch of messages in one call instead of getting them one-at-a-time.

When receiving batched messages one-at-a-time, the last message has the `isLastInBatch` message property set to true.

In addition, received batched messages now contain the `amqp_batchSize` header.

Listeners can also consume batches created in the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`, even if the batch is not created by the producer.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/choose-container.adoc[Choosing a Container] for more information.

Spring Data Projection interfaces are now supported by the `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#data-projection[Using Spring Data Projection Interfaces] for more information.

The `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter` now assumes the content is JSON if there is no `contentType` property, or it is the default (`application/octet-string`).
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#JacksonJsonMessageConverter-from-message[Converting from a `Message`] for more information.

Similarly. the `Jackson2XmlMessageConverter` now assumes the content is XML if there is no `contentType` property, or it is the default (`application/octet-string`).
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#jackson-xml[`Jackson2XmlMessageConverter`] for more information.

When a `@RabbitListener` method returns a result, the bean and `Method` are now available in the reply message properties.
This allows configuration of a `beforeSendReplyMessagePostProcessor` to, for example, set a header in the reply to indicate which method was invoked on the server.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/reply.adoc[Reply Management] for more information.

You can now configure a `ReplyPostProcessor` to make modifications to a reply message before it is sent.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/reply.adoc[Reply Management] for more information.

[[amqp-logging-appenders-changes]]
== AMQP Logging Appenders Changes

The Log4J and Logback `AmqpAppender` s now support a `verifyHostname` SSL option.

Also these appenders now can be configured to not add MDC entries as headers.
The `addMdcAsHeaders` boolean option has been introduces to configure such a behavior.

The appenders now support the `SaslConfig` property.

See xref:logging.adoc[Logging Subsystem AMQP Appenders] for more information.

[[messagelisteneradapter-changes]]
== MessageListenerAdapter Changes

The `MessageListenerAdapter` provides now a new `buildListenerArguments(Object, Channel, Message)` method  to build an array of arguments to be passed into target listener and an old one is deprecated.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-consumer.adoc#message-listener-adapter[`MessageListenerAdapter`] for more information.

[[exchange/queue-declaration-changes]]
== Exchange/Queue Declaration Changes

The `ExchangeBuilder` and `QueueBuilder` fluent APIs used to create `Exchange` and `Queue` objects for declaration by `RabbitAdmin` now support "well known" arguments.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#builder-api[Builder API for Queues and Exchanges] for more information.

The `RabbitAdmin` has a new property `explicitDeclarationsOnly`.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#conditional-declaration[Conditional Declaration] for more information.

[[connection-factory-changes]]
== Connection Factory Changes

The `CachingConnectionFactory` has a new property `shuffleAddresses`.
When providing a list of broker node addresses, the list will be shuffled before creating a connection so that the order in which the connections are attempted is random.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#cluster[Connecting to a Cluster] for more information.

When using Publisher confirms and returns, the callbacks are now invoked on the connection factory's `executor`.
This avoids a possible deadlock in the `amqp-clients` library if you perform rabbit operations from within the callback.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-confirms[Correlated Publisher Confirms and Returns] for more information.

Also, the publisher confirm type is now specified with the `ConfirmType` enum instead of the two mutually exclusive setter methods.

The `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` now uses TLS 1.2 by default when SSL is enabled.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#rabbitconnectionfactorybean-configuring-ssl[`RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` and Configuring SSL] for more information.

[[new-messagepostprocessor-classes]]
== New MessagePostProcessor Classes

Classes `DeflaterPostProcessor` and `InflaterPostProcessor` were added to support compression and decompression, respectively, when the message content-encoding is set to `deflate`.

[[other-changes]]
== Other Changes

The `Declarables` object (for declaring multiple queues, exchanges, bindings) now has a filtered getter for each type.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#collection-declaration[Declaring Collections of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings] for more information.

You can now customize each `Declarable` bean before the `RabbitAdmin` processes the declaration thereof.
See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#automatic-declaration[Automatic Declaration of Exchanges, Queues, and Bindings] for more information.

`singleActiveConsumer()` has been added to the `QueueBuilder` to set the `x-single-active-consumer` queue argument.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#builder-api[Builder API for Queues and Exchanges] for more information.

Outbound headers with values of type `Class<?>` are now mapped using `getName()` instead of `toString()`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#message-properties-converters[Message Properties Converters] for more information.

Recovery of failed producer-created batches is now supported.
See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#batch-retry[Retry with Batch Listeners] for more information.
