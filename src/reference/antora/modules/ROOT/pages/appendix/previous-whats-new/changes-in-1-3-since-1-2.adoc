[[changes-in-1-3-since-1-2]]
= Changes in 1.3 Since 1.2

[[listener-concurrency]]
== Listener Concurrency

The listener container now supports dynamic scaling of the number of consumers based on workload, or you can programmatically change the concurrency without stopping the container.
See xref:amqp/listener-concurrency.adoc#listener-concurrency[Listener Concurrency].

[[listener-queues]]
== Listener Queues

The listener container now permits the queues on which it listens to be modified at runtime.
Also, the container now starts if at least one of its configured queues is available for use.
See xref:amqp/listener-queues.adoc#listener-queues[Listener Container Queues]

This listener container now redeclares any auto-delete queues during startup.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-consumer.adoc#lc-auto-delete[`auto-delete` Queues].

[[consumer-priority]]
== Consumer Priority

The listener container now supports consumer arguments, letting the `x-priority` argument be set.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-consumer.adoc#consumer-priority[Consumer Priority].

[[exclusive-consumer]]
== Exclusive Consumer

You can now configure `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` with a single `exclusive` consumer, preventing other consumers from listening to the queue.
See xref:amqp/exclusive-consumer.adoc[Exclusive Consumer].

[[rabbit-admin]]
== Rabbit Admin

You can now have the broker generate the queue name, regardless of `durable`, `autoDelete`, and `exclusive` settings.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc[Configuring the Broker].

[[direct-exchange-binding]]
== Direct Exchange Binding

Previously, omitting the `key` attribute from a `binding` element of a `direct-exchange` configuration caused the queue or exchange to be bound with an empty string as the routing key.
Now it is bound with the the name of the provided `Queue` or `Exchange`.
If you wish to bind with an empty string routing key, you need to specify `key=""`.

[[amqptemplate-changes]]
== `AmqpTemplate` Changes

The `AmqpTemplate` now provides several synchronous `receiveAndReply` methods.
These are implemented by the `RabbitTemplate`.
For more information see xref:amqp/receiving-messages.adoc[Receiving Messages].

The `RabbitTemplate` now supports configuring a `RetryTemplate` to attempt retries (with optional back-off policy) for when the broker is not available.
For more information see xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-retry[Adding Retry Capabilities].

[[caching-connection-factory]]
== Caching Connection Factory

You can now configure the caching connection factory to cache `Connection` instances and their `Channel` instances instead of using a single connection and caching only `Channel` instances.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management].

[[binding-arguments]]
== Binding Arguments

The `<binding>` of the `<exchange>` now supports parsing of the `<binding-arguments>` sub-element.
You can now configure the `<binding>` of the `<headers-exchange>` with a `key/value` attribute pair (to match on a single header) or with a `<binding-arguments>` sub-element (allowing matching on multiple headers).
These options are mutually exclusive.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#headers-exchange[Headers Exchange].

== Routing Connection Factory

A new `SimpleRoutingConnectionFactory` has been introduced.
It allows configuration of `ConnectionFactories` mapping, to determine the target `ConnectionFactory` to use at runtime.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#routing-connection-factory[Routing Connection Factory].

[[messagebuilder-and-messagepropertiesbuilder]]
== `MessageBuilder` and `MessagePropertiesBuilder`

"`Fluent APIs`" for building messages or message properties are now provided.
See xref:amqp/sending-messages.adoc#message-builder[Message Builder API].

[[retryinterceptorbuilder-change]]
== `RetryInterceptorBuilder` Change

A "`Fluent API`" for building listener container retry interceptors is now provided.
See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#retry[Failures in Synchronous Operations and Options for Retry].

[[republishmessagerecoverer-added]]
== `RepublishMessageRecoverer` Added

This new `MessageRecoverer` is provided to allow publishing a failed message to another queue (including stack trace information in the header) when retries are exhausted.
See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#async-listeners[Message Listeners and the Asynchronous Case].

[[default-error-handler-since-1-3-2]]
== Default Error Handler (Since 1.3.2)

A default `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` has been added to the listener container.
This error handler detects fatal message conversion problems and instructs the container to reject the message to prevent the broker from continually redelivering the unconvertible message.
See xref:amqp/exception-handling.adoc[Exception Handling].

[[listener-container-missingqueuesfatal-property-since-1-3-5]]
== Listener Container 'missingQueuesFatal` Property (Since 1.3.5)

The `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` now has a property called `missingQueuesFatal` (default: `true`).
Previously, missing queues were always fatal.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration].
