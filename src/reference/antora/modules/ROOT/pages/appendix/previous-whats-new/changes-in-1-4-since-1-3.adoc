[[changes-in-1-4-since-1-3]]
= Changes in 1.4 Since 1.3

[[rabbitlistener-annotation]]
== `@RabbitListener` Annotation

POJO listeners can be annotated with `@RabbitListener`, enabled by `@EnableRabbit` or `<rabbit:annotation-driven />`.
Spring Framework 4.1 is required for this feature.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

[[rabbitmessagingtemplate-added]]
== `RabbitMessagingTemplate` Added

A new `RabbitMessagingTemplate` lets you interact with RabbitMQ by using `spring-messaging` `Message` instances.
Internally, it uses the `RabbitTemplate`, which you can configure as normal.
Spring Framework 4.1 is required for this feature.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-messaging[Messaging Integration] for more information.

[[listener-container-missingqueuesfatal-attribute]]
== Listener Container `missingQueuesFatal` Attribute

1.3.5 introduced the `missingQueuesFatal` property on the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`.
This is now available on the listener container namespace element.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration].

[[rabbittemplate-confirmcallback-interface]]
== RabbitTemplate `ConfirmCallback` Interface

The `confirm` method on this interface has an additional parameter called `cause`.
When available, this parameter contains the reason for a negative acknowledgement (nack).
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-confirms[Correlated Publisher Confirms and Returns].

[[rabbitconnectionfactorybean-added]]
== `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` Added

`RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` creates the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` used by the `CachingConnectionFactory`.
This enables configuration of SSL options using Spring's dependency injection.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#connection-factory[Configuring the Underlying Client Connection Factory].

[[using-cachingconnectionfactory]]
== Using `CachingConnectionFactory`

The `CachingConnectionFactory` now lets the `connectionTimeout` be set as a property or as an attribute in the namespace.
It sets the property on the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory`.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#connection-factory[Configuring the Underlying Client Connection Factory].

[[log-appender]]
== Log Appender

The Logback `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.logback.AmqpAppender` has been introduced.
It provides options similar to `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.log4j.AmqpAppender`.
For more information, see the JavaDoc of these classes.

The Log4j `AmqpAppender` now supports the `deliveryMode` property (`PERSISTENT` or `NON_PERSISTENT`, default: `PERSISTENT`).
Previously, all log4j messages were `PERSISTENT`.

The appender also supports modification of the `Message` before sending -- allowing, for example, the addition of custom headers.
Subclasses should override the `postProcessMessageBeforeSend()`.

[[listener-queues]]
== Listener Queues

The listener container now, by default, redeclares any missing queues during startup.
A new `auto-declare` attribute has been added to the `<rabbit:listener-container>` to prevent these re-declarations.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-consumer.adoc#lc-auto-delete[`auto-delete` Queues].

[[rabbittemplate:-mandatory-and-connectionfactoryselector-expressions]]
== `RabbitTemplate`: `mandatory` and `connectionFactorySelector` Expressions

The `mandatoryExpression`, `sendConnectionFactorySelectorExpression`, and `receiveConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` SpEL Expression`s properties have been added to `RabbitTemplate`.
The `mandatoryExpression` is used to evaluate a `mandatory` boolean value against each request message when a `ReturnCallback` is in use.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-confirms[Correlated Publisher Confirms and Returns].
The `sendConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` and `receiveConnectionFactorySelectorExpression` are used when an `AbstractRoutingConnectionFactory` is provided, to determine the `lookupKey` for the target `ConnectionFactory` at runtime on each AMQP protocol interaction operation.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#routing-connection-factory[Routing Connection Factory].

[[listeners-and-the-routing-connection-factory]]
== Listeners and the Routing Connection Factory

You can configure a `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` with a routing connection factory to enable connection selection based on the queue names.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#routing-connection-factory[Routing Connection Factory].

[[rabbittemplate:-recoverycallback-option]]
== `RabbitTemplate`: `RecoveryCallback` Option

The `recoveryCallback` property has been added for use in the `retryTemplate.execute()`.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#template-retry[Adding Retry Capabilities].

[[messageconversionexception-change]]
== `MessageConversionException` Change

This exception is now a subclass of `AmqpException`.
Consider the following code:

[source,java]
----
try {
    template.convertAndSend("thing1", "thing2", "cat");
}
catch (AmqpException e) {
	...
}
catch (MessageConversionException e) {
	...
}
----

The second catch block is no longer reachable and needs to be moved above the catch-all `AmqpException` catch block.

[[rabbitmq-3-4-compatibility]]
== RabbitMQ 3.4 Compatibility

Spring AMQP is now compatible with the RabbitMQ 3.4, including direct reply-to.
See xref:introduction/quick-tour.adoc#compatibility[Compatibility] and xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#direct-reply-to[RabbitMQ Direct reply-to] for more information.

[[contenttypedelegatingmessageconverter-added]]
== `ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter` Added

The `ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter` has been introduced to select the `MessageConverter` to use, based on the `contentType` property in the `MessageProperties`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc[Message Converters] for more information.
