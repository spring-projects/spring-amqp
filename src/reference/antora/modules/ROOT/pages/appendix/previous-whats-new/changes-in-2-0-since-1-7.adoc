[[changes-in-2-0-since-1-7]]
= Changes in 2.0 Since 1.7

[[using-cachingconnectionfactory]]
== Using `CachingConnectionFactory`

Starting with version 2.0.2, you can configure the `RabbitTemplate` to use a different connection to that used by listener containers.
This change avoids deadlocked consumers when producers are blocked for any reason.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#separate-connection[Using a Separate Connection] for more information.

[[amqp-client-library]]
== AMQP Client library

Spring AMQP now uses the new 5.0.x version of the `amqp-client` library provided by the RabbitMQ team.
This client has auto recovery configured by default.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#auto-recovery[RabbitMQ Automatic Connection/Topology recovery].

NOTE: As of version 4.0, the client enables automatic recovery by default.
While compatible with this feature, Spring AMQP has its own recovery mechanisms, and the client recovery feature generally is not needed.
We recommend that you disable `amqp-client` automatic recovery, to avoid getting `AutoRecoverConnectionNotCurrentlyOpenException` instances when the broker is available but the connection has not yet recovered.
Starting with version 1.7.1, Spring AMQP disables it unless you explicitly create your own RabbitMQ connection factory and provide it to the `CachingConnectionFactory`.
RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory` instances created by the `RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` also have the option disabled by default.

[[general-changes]]
== General Changes

The `ExchangeBuilder` now builds durable exchanges by default.
The `@Exchange` annotation used within a `@QeueueBinding` also declares durable exchanges by default.
The `@Queue` annotation used within a `@RabbitListener` by default declares durable queues if named and non-durable if anonymous.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#builder-api[Builder API for Queues and Exchanges] and xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

[[deleted-classes]]
== Deleted Classes

`UniquelyNameQueue` is no longer provided.
It is unusual to create a durable non-auto-delete queue with a unique name.
This class has been deleted.
If you require its functionality, use `new Queue(UUID.randomUUID().toString())`.

[[new-listener-container]]
== New Listener Container

The `DirectMessageListenerContainer` has been added alongside the existing `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/choose-container.adoc[Choosing a Container] and xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] for information about choosing which container to use as well as how to configure them.


[[log4j-appender]]
== Log4j Appender

This appender is no longer available due to the end-of-life of log4j.
See xref:logging.adoc[Logging Subsystem AMQP Appenders] for information about the available log appenders.


[[rabbittemplate-changes]]
== `RabbitTemplate` Changes

IMPORTANT: Previously, a non-transactional `RabbitTemplate` participated in an existing transaction if it ran on a transactional listener container thread.
This was a serious bug.
However, users might have relied on this behavior.
Starting with version 1.6.2, you must set the `channelTransacted` boolean on the template for it to participate in the container transaction.

The `RabbitTemplate` now uses a `DirectReplyToMessageListenerContainer` (by default) instead of creating a new consumer for each request.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#direct-reply-to[RabbitMQ Direct reply-to] for more information.

The `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now supports direct reply-to.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#async-template[Async Rabbit Template] for more information.

The `RabbitTemplate` and `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now have `receiveAndConvert` and `convertSendAndReceiveAsType` methods that take a `ParameterizedTypeReference<T>` argument, letting the caller specify the type to which to convert the result.
This is particularly useful for complex types or when type information is not conveyed in message headers.
It requires a `SmartMessageConverter` such as the `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc[Request/Reply Messaging], xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#async-template[Async Rabbit Template], xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#json-complex[Converting From a `Message` With `RabbitTemplate`], and xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#json-complex[Converting From a `Message` With `RabbitTemplate`] for more information.

You can now use a `RabbitTemplate` to perform multiple operations on a dedicated channel.
See xref:amqp/template.adoc#scoped-operations[Scoped Operations] for more information.

[[listener-adapter]]
== Listener Adapter

A convenient `FunctionalInterface` is available for using lambdas with the `MessageListenerAdapter`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-consumer.adoc#message-listener-adapter[`MessageListenerAdapter`] for more information.

[[listener-container-changes]]
== Listener Container Changes

[[prefetch-default-value]]
=== Prefetch Default Value

The prefetch default value used to be 1, which could lead to under-utilization of efficient consumers.
The default prefetch value is now 250, which should keep consumers busy in most common scenarios and,
thus, improve throughput.

IMPORTANT: There are scenarios where the prefetch value should
be low -- for example, with large messages, especially if the processing is slow (messages could add up
to a large amount of memory in the client process), and if strict message ordering is necessary
(the prefetch value should be set back to 1 in this case).
Also, with low-volume messaging and multiple consumers (including concurrency within a single listener container instance), you may wish to reduce the prefetch to get a more even distribution of messages across consumers.

For more background about prefetch, see this post about https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2014/04/14/finding-bottlenecks-with-rabbitmq-3-3/[consumer utilization in RabbitMQ]
and this post about https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2012/05/11/some-queuing-theory-throughput-latency-and-bandwidth/[queuing theory].

[[message-count]]
=== Message Count

Previously, `MessageProperties.getMessageCount()` returned `0` for messages emitted by the container.
This property applies only when you use `basicGet` (for example, from `RabbitTemplate.receive()` methods) and is now initialized to `null` for container messages.

[[transaction-rollback-behavior]]
=== Transaction Rollback Behavior

Message re-queue on transaction rollback is now consistent, regardless of whether or not a transaction manager is configured.
See xref:amqp/transactions.adoc#transaction-rollback[A note on Rollback of Received Messages] for more information.

[[shutdown-behavior]]
=== Shutdown Behavior

If the container threads do not respond to a shutdown within `shutdownTimeout`, the channels are forced closed by default.
See xref:amqp/containerAttributes.adoc[Message Listener Container Configuration] for more information.

[[after-receive-message-post-processors]]
=== After Receive Message Post Processors

If a `MessagePostProcessor` in the `afterReceiveMessagePostProcessors` property returns `null`, the message is discarded (and acknowledged if appropriate).

[[connection-factory-changes]]
== Connection Factory Changes

The connection and channel listener interfaces now provide a mechanism to obtain information about exceptions.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#connection-channel-listeners[Connection and Channel Listeners] and xref:amqp/template.adoc#publishing-is-async[Publishing is Asynchronous -- How to Detect Successes and Failures] for more information.

A new `ConnectionNameStrategy` is now provided to populate the application-specific identification of the target RabbitMQ connection from the `AbstractConnectionFactory`.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management] for more information.

[[retry-changes]]
== Retry Changes

The `MissingMessageIdAdvice` is no longer provided.
Its functionality is now built-in.
See xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#retry[Failures in Synchronous Operations and Options for Retry] for more information.

[[anonymous-queue-naming]]
== Anonymous Queue Naming

By default, `AnonymousQueues` are now named with the default `Base64UrlNamingStrategy` instead of a simple `UUID` string.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#anonymous-queue[`AnonymousQueue`] for more information.

[[rabbitlistener-changes]]
== `@RabbitListener` Changes

You can now provide simple queue declarations (bound only to the default exchange) in `@RabbitListener` annotations.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

You can now configure `@RabbitListener` annotations so that any exceptions are returned to the sender.
You can also configure a `RabbitListenerErrorHandler` to handle exceptions.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/error-handling.adoc[Handling Exceptions] for more information.

You can now bind a queue with multiple routing keys when you use the `@QueueBinding` annotation.
Also `@QueueBinding.exchange()` now supports custom exchange types and declares durable exchanges by default.

You can now set the `concurrency` of the listener container at the annotation level rather than having to configure a different container factory for different concurrency settings.

You can now set the `autoStartup` property of the listener container at the annotation level, overriding the default setting in the container factory.

You can now set after receive and before send (reply) `MessagePostProcessor` instances in the `RabbitListener` container factories.

See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven.adoc[Annotation-driven Listener Endpoints] for more information.

Starting with version 2.0.3, one of the `@RabbitHandler` annotations on a class-level `@RabbitListener` can be designated as the default.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/method-selection.adoc[Multi-method Listeners] for more information.

[[container-conditional-rollback]]
== Container Conditional Rollback

When using an external transaction manager (such as JDBC), rule-based rollback is now supported when you provide the container with a transaction attribute.
It is also now more flexible when you use a transaction advice.
See xref:amqp/transactions.adoc#conditional-rollback[Conditional Rollback] for more information.

[[remove-jackson-1-x-support]]
== Remove Jackson 1.x support

Deprecated in previous versions, Jackson `1.x` converters and related components have now been deleted.
You can use similar components based on Jackson 2.x.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#json-message-converter[`Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`] for more information.

[[json-message-converter]]
== JSON Message Converter

When the `__TypeId__` is set to `Hashtable` for an inbound JSON message, the default conversion type is now `LinkedHashMap`.
Previously, it was `Hashtable`.
To revert to a `Hashtable`, you can use `setDefaultMapType` on the `DefaultClassMapper`.

[[xml-parsers]]
== XML Parsers

When parsing `Queue` and `Exchange` XML components, the parsers no longer register the `name` attribute value as a bean alias if an `id` attribute is present.
See xref:amqp/broker-configuration.adoc#note-id-name[A Note On the `id` and `name` Attributes] for more information.

[[blocked-connection]]
== Blocked Connection
You can now inject the `com.rabbitmq.client.BlockedListener` into the `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.connection.Connection` object.
Also, the `ConnectionBlockedEvent` and `ConnectionUnblockedEvent` events are emitted by the `ConnectionFactory` when the connection is blocked or unblocked by the Broker.

See xref:amqp/connections.adoc[Connection and Resource Management] for more information.
