[[changes-in-3-0-since-2-4]]
= Changes in 3.0 Since 2.4

[[java-17-spring-framework-6-0]]
== Java 17, Spring Framework 6.0

This version requires Spring Framework 6.0 and Java 17

[[remoting]]
== Remoting

The remoting feature (using RMI) is no longer supported.

[[observation]]
== Observation

Enabling observation for timers and tracing using Micrometer is now supported.
See xref:stream.adoc#stream-micrometer-observation[Micrometer Observation] for more information.

[[x30-Native]]
== Native Images

Support for creating native images is provided.
See xref:appendix/previous-whats-new/changes-in-3-0-since-2-4.adoc#x30-Native[Native Images] for more information.

[[asyncrabbittemplate]]
== AsyncRabbitTemplate

IMPORTANT: The `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now returns `CompletableFuture` s instead of `ListenableFuture` s.
See xref:amqp/request-reply.adoc#async-template[Async Rabbit Template] for more information.

[[stream-support-changes]]
== Stream Support Changes

IMPORTANT: `RabbitStreamOperations` and `RabbitStreamTemplate` methods now return `CompletableFuture` instead of `ListenableFuture`.

Super streams and single active consumers thereon are now supported.

See xref:stream.adoc[Using the RabbitMQ Stream Plugin] for more information.

[[rabbitlistener-changes]]
== `@RabbitListener` Changes

Batch listeners can now consume `Collection<?>` as well as `List<?>`.
The batch messaging adapter now ensures that the method is suitable for consuming batches.
When setting the container factory `consumerBatchEnabled` to `true`, the `batchListener` property is also set to `true`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/batch.adoc[@RabbitListener with Batching] for more information.

`MessageConverter` s can now return `Optional.empty()` for a null value; this is currently implemented by the `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#JacksonJsonMessageConverter-from-message[Converting from a `Message`] for more information

You can now configure a `ReplyPostProcessor` via the container factory rather than via a property on `@RabbitListener`.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-annotation-driven/reply.adoc[Reply Management] for more information.

The `@RabbitListener` (and `@RabbitHandler`) methods can now be declared as Kotlin `suspend` functions.
See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/async-returns.adoc[Asynchronous `@RabbitListener` Return Types] for more information.

Starting with version 3.0.5, listeners with async return types (including Kotlin suspend functions) invoke the `RabbitListenerErrorHandler` (if configured) after a failure.
Previously, the error handler was only invoked with synchronous invocations.

[[connection-factory-changes]]
== Connection Factory Changes

The default `addressShuffleMode` in `AbstractConnectionFactory` is now `RANDOM`.
This results in connecting to a random host when multiple addresses are provided.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#cluster[Connecting to a Cluster] for more information.

The `LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory` no longer uses the RabbitMQ `http-client` library to determine which node is the leader for a queue.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#queue-affinity[Queue Affinity and the `LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory`] for more information.
