= Logging Subsystem AMQP Appenders

The framework provides logging appenders for some popular logging subsystems:

* logback (since Spring AMQP version 1.4)
* log4j2 (since Spring AMQP version 1.6)

The appenders are configured by using the normal mechanisms for the logging subsystem, available properties are specified in the following sections.

[[common-properties]]
== Common properties

The following properties are available with all appenders:

.Common Appender Properties
[cols="2l,2l,4", options="header"]
|===
| Property
| Default
| Description

| exchangeName
| logs
| Name of the exchange to which to publish log events.

| exchangeType
| topic
| Type of the exchange to which to publish log events -- needed only if the appender declares the exchange.
See `declareExchange`.

| routingKeyPattern
| %c.%p
| Logging subsystem pattern format to use to generate a routing key.

| applicationId
|
| Application ID -- added to the routing key if the pattern includes `+%X{applicationId}+`.

| senderPoolSize
| 2
| The number of threads to use to publish log events.

| maxSenderRetries
| 30
| How many times to retry sending a message if the broker is unavailable or there is some other error.
Retries are delayed as follows: `N ^ log(N)`, where `N` is the retry number.

| addresses
|
| A comma-delimited list of broker addresses in the following form: `host:port[,host:port]*` - overrides `host` and `port`.

| host
| localhost
| RabbitMQ host to which to connect .

| port
| 5672
| RabbitMQ port to which to connect.

| virtualHost
| /
| RabbitMQ virtual host to which to connect.

| username
| guest
| RabbitMQ user to use when connecting.

| password
| guest
| RabbitMQ password for this user.

| useSsl
| false
| Whether to use SSL for the RabbitMQ connection.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#rabbitconnectionfactorybean-configuring-ssl[`RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` and Configuring SSL]

| verifyHostname
| true
| Enable server hostname verification for TLS connections.
See xref:amqp/connections.adoc#rabbitconnectionfactorybean-configuring-ssl[`RabbitConnectionFactoryBean` and Configuring SSL]

| sslAlgorithm
| null
| The SSL algorithm to use.

| sslPropertiesLocation
| null
| Location of the SSL properties file.

| keyStore
| null
| Location of the keystore.

| keyStorePassphrase
| null
| Passphrase for the keystore.

| keyStoreType
| JKS
| The keystore type.

| trustStore
| null
| Location of the truststore.

| trustStorePassphrase
| null
| Passphrase for the truststore.

| trustStoreType
| JKS
| The truststore type.

| saslConfig
| null (RabbitMQ client default applies)
| The `saslConfig` - see the javadoc for `RabbitUtils.stringToSaslConfig` for valid values.

| contentType
| text/plain
| `content-type` property of log messages.

| contentEncoding
|
| `content-encoding` property of log messages.

| declareExchange
| false
| Whether or not to declare the configured exchange when this appender starts.
See also `durable` and `autoDelete`.

| durable
| true
| When `declareExchange` is `true`, the durable flag is set to this value.

| autoDelete
| false
| When `declareExchange` is `true`, the auto-delete flag is set to this value.

| charset
| null
| Character set to use when converting `String` to `byte[]`.
Default: null (the system default charset is used).
If the character set is unsupported on the current platform, we fall back to using the system character set.

| deliveryMode
| PERSISTENT
| `PERSISTENT` or `NON_PERSISTENT` to determine whether or not RabbitMQ should persist the messages.

| generateId
| false
| Used to determine whether the `messageId` property is set to a unique value.

| clientConnectionProperties
| null
| A comma-delimited list of `key:value` pairs for custom client properties to the RabbitMQ connection.

| addMdcAsHeaders
| true
| MDC properties were always added into RabbitMQ message headers until this property was introduced.
It can lead to issues for big MDC as while RabbitMQ has limited buffer size for all headers and this buffer is pretty small.
This property was introduced to avoid issues in cases of big MDC.
By default this value set to `true` for backward compatibility.
The `false` turns off serialization MDC into headers.
Please note, the `JsonLayout` adds MDC into the message by default.

[[log4j-2-appender]]
== Log4j 2 Appender

The following example shows how to configure a Log4j 2 appender:

[source, xml]
----
<Appenders>
    ...
    <RabbitMQ name="rabbitmq"
        addresses="foo:5672,bar:5672" user="guest" password="guest" virtualHost="/"
        exchange="log4j2" exchangeType="topic" declareExchange="true" durable="true" autoDelete="false"
        applicationId="myAppId" routingKeyPattern="%X{applicationId}.%c.%p"
        contentType="text/plain" contentEncoding="UTF-8" generateId="true" deliveryMode="NON_PERSISTENT"
        charset="UTF-8"
        senderPoolSize="3" maxSenderRetries="5"
        addMdcAsHeaders="false">
    </RabbitMQ>
</Appenders>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Starting with versions 1.6.10 and 1.7.3, by default, the log4j2 appender publishes the messages to RabbitMQ on the calling thread.
This is because Log4j 2 does not, by default, create thread-safe events.
If the broker is down, the `maxSenderRetries` is used to retry, with no delay between retries.
If you wish to restore the previous behavior of publishing the messages on separate threads (`senderPoolSize`), you can set the `async` property to `true`.
However, you also need to configure Log4j 2 to use the `DefaultLogEventFactory` instead of the `ReusableLogEventFactory`.
One way to do that is to set the system property `-Dlog4j2.enable.threadlocals=false`.
If you use asynchronous publishing with the `ReusableLogEventFactory`, events have a high likelihood of being corrupted due to cross-talk.

[[logback-appender]]
== Logback Appender

The following example shows how to configure a logback appender:

[source, xml]
----
<appender name="AMQP" class="org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.logback.AmqpAppender">
    <layout>
        <pattern><![CDATA[ %d %p %t [%c] - <%m>%n ]]></pattern>
    </layout>
    <addresses>foo:5672,bar:5672</addresses>
    <abbreviation>36</abbreviation>
    <includeCallerData>false</includeCallerData>
    <applicationId>myApplication</applicationId>
    <routingKeyPattern>%property{applicationId}.%c.%p</routingKeyPattern>
    <generateId>true</generateId>
    <charset>UTF-8</charset>
    <durable>false</durable>
    <deliveryMode>NON_PERSISTENT</deliveryMode>
    <declareExchange>true</declareExchange>
    <addMdcAsHeaders>false</addMdcAsHeaders>
</appender>
----

Starting with version 1.7.1, the Logback `AmqpAppender` provides  an `includeCallerData` option, which is `false` by default.
Extracting caller data can be rather expensive, because the log event has to create a throwable and inspect it to determine the calling location.
Therefore, by default, caller data associated with an event is not extracted when the event is added to the event queue.
You can configure the appender to include caller data by setting the `includeCallerData` property to `true`.

Starting with version 2.0.0, the Logback `AmqpAppender` supports https://logback.qos.ch/manual/encoders.html[Logback encoders] with the `encoder` option.
The `encoder` and `layout` options are mutually exclusive.

[[customizing-the-messages]]
== Customizing the Messages

By default, AMQP appenders populate the following message properties:

* `deliveryMode`
* contentType
* `contentEncoding`, if configured
* `messageId`, if `generateId` is configured
* `timestamp` of the log event
* `appId`, if applicationId is configured

In addition they populate headers with the following values:

* `categoryName` of the log event
* The level of the log event
* `thread`: the name of the thread where log event happened
* The location of the stack trace of the log event call
* A copy of all the MDC properties (unless `addMdcAsHeaders` is set to `false`)

Each of the appenders can be subclassed, letting you modify the messages before publishing.
The following example shows how to customize log messages:


[source, java]
----
public class MyEnhancedAppender extends AmqpAppender {

    @Override
    public Message postProcessMessageBeforeSend(Message message, Event event) {
        message.getMessageProperties().setHeader("foo", "bar");
        return message;
    }

}
----

Starting with 2.2.4, the log4j2 `AmqpAppender` can be extended using `@PluginBuilderFactory` and extending also `AmqpAppender.Builder`


[source, java]
----
@Plugin(name = "MyEnhancedAppender", category = "Core", elementType = "appender", printObject = true)
public class MyEnhancedAppender extends AmqpAppender {

	public MyEnhancedAppender(String name, Filter filter, Layout<? extends Serializable> layout,
			boolean ignoreExceptions, AmqpManager manager, BlockingQueue<Event> eventQueue, String foo, String bar) {
		super(name, filter, layout, ignoreExceptions, manager, eventQueue);

	@Override
	public Message postProcessMessageBeforeSend(Message message, Event event) {
			message.getMessageProperties().setHeader("foo", "bar");
		return message;
	}

	@PluginBuilderFactory
	public static Builder newBuilder() {
		return new Builder();
	}

	protected static class Builder extends AmqpAppender.Builder {

		@Override
		protected AmqpAppender buildInstance(String name, Filter filter, Layout<? extends Serializable> layout,
				boolean ignoreExceptions, AmqpManager manager, BlockingQueue<Event> eventQueue) {
			return new MyEnhancedAppender(name, filter, layout, ignoreExceptions, manager, eventQueue);
		}
	}

}
----



[[customizing-the-client-properties]]
== Customizing the Client Properties

You can add custom client properties by adding either string properties or more complex properties.

[[simple-string-properties]]
=== Simple String Properties

Each appender supports adding client properties to the RabbitMQ connection.

The following example shows how to add a custom client property for logback:

[source, xml]
----
<appender name="AMQP" ...>
    ...
    <clientConnectionProperties>thing1:thing2,cat:hat</clientConnectionProperties>
    ...
</appender>
----

.log4j2
[source, xml]
----
<Appenders>
    ...
    <RabbitMQ name="rabbitmq"
        ...
        clientConnectionProperties="thing1:thing2,cat:hat"
        ...
    </RabbitMQ>
</Appenders>
----

The properties are a comma-delimited list of `key:value` pairs.
Keys and values cannot contain commas or colons.

These properties appear on the RabbitMQ Admin UI when the connection is viewed.

[[advanced-technique-for-logback]]
=== Advanced Technique for Logback

You can subclass the Logback appender.
Doing so lets you modify the client connection properties before the connection is established.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
public class MyEnhancedAppender extends AmqpAppender {

    private String thing1;

    @Override
    protected void updateConnectionClientProperties(Map<String, Object> clientProperties) {
        clientProperties.put("thing1", this.thing1);
    }

    public void setThing1(String thing1) {
        this.thing1 = thing1;
    }

}
----

Then you can add `<thing1>thing2</thing1>` to logback.xml.

For String properties such as those shown in the preceding example, the previous technique can be used.
Subclasses allow for adding richer properties (such as adding a `Map` or numeric property).

[[providing-a-custom-queue-implementation]]
== Providing a Custom Queue Implementation

The `AmqpAppenders` use a `BlockingQueue` to asynchronously publish logging events to RabbitMQ.
By default, a `LinkedBlockingQueue` is used.
However, you can supply any kind of custom `BlockingQueue` implementation.

The following example shows how to do so for Logback:

[source, java]
----
public class MyEnhancedAppender extends AmqpAppender {

    @Override
    protected BlockingQueue<Event> createEventQueue() {
        return new ArrayBlockingQueue();
    }

}
----

The Log4j 2 appender supports using a https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders/delegating.html#BlockingQueueFactory[`BlockingQueueFactory`], as the following example shows:

[source, xml]
----
<Appenders>
    ...
    <RabbitMQ name="rabbitmq"
              bufferSize="10" ... >
        <ArrayBlockingQueue/>
    </RabbitMQ>
</Appenders>
----
