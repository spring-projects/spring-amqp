[[amqp10-client]]
= Generic AMQP 1.0 Support

Version 4.1 introduces `spring-amqp-client` module for https://www.amqp.org/resources/specifications[AMQP 1.0] protocol support.

This artifact is based on the https://github.com/apache/qpid-protonj2/blob/main/protonj2-client/README.md[Qpid ProtonJ2 Client Library] and can work with any peers supporting AMQP 1.0 protocol, including RabbitMQ broker.

This dependency has to be added to the project to be able to interact with AMQP 1.0 support:

[[amqp10-client-environment]]
== AMQP 1.0 Environment

The `org.apache.qpid:protonj2-client` is so flexible and comes with many convenient API, that it can be used in Spring applications even without any dedicated Spring implementations.
For example, the `org.apache.qpid.protonj2.client.Message` class is a builder pattern implementation.
Either way, the `spring-amqp-client` provides high-level Spring pattern implementations for connection lifecycle management and AMQP 1.0 protocol interaction for sending and receiving messages operations.
The AMQP 1.0 environment starts with a `org.apache.qpid.protonj2.client.Client` instance:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
Client protonClient() {
    return Client.create();
}
----

The same `Client` can be used for connecting to different brokers, the connection setting must be provided on specific connection.
See below.

[[amqp10-client-connection-factory]]
== AMQP 1.0 Connection Factory

The `org.springframework.amqp.client.AmqpConnectionFactory` abstraction was introduced to manage `org.apache.qpid.protonj2.client.Connection`.
The `SingleAmqpConnectionFactory` implementation is present to manage one connection and its settings.
The same `Connection` can be shared between many producers and consumers.
The multiplexing is handled by the link abstraction for AMQP 1.0 protocol implementation internally in the AMQP client library.
The `Connection` has recovery capabilities.

In most cases there is just enough to add this bean into the project:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory(Client protonClient) {
    return new SingleAmqpConnectionFactory(protonClient);
}
----

See `SingleAmqpConnectionFactory` setters for all connection-specific options, including `host`, `port`, `user`.
The more advance configuration could be done by the `setConnectionOptions(ConnectionOptions)` which is a builder API from ProtonJ library.
The mentioned `SingleAmqpConnectionFactory` instance with all the defaults would connect to the `localhost:5672` with infinite number of reconnections.

[[amqp10-client-api]]
== `AmqpClient`

The `AmqpClient` is a fluent API to perform send and receive operations on messages against AMQP 1.0 protocol.
Requires an `AmqpConnectionFactory` and can be configured with some defaults via `AmqpClient.Builder` API.
The `DefaultAmqpClient` is an internal implementation of the `AmqpClient` contract.
Even if `org.apache.qpid:protonj2-client` library comes with a `org.apache.qpid.protonj2.client.Message` implementation, the `AmqpClient` still exposes an API based on the well-known `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` with all the supporting classes like `MessageProperties` and `MessageConverter` abstractions.
The conversion to/from `org.apache.qpid.protonj2.client.Message` is done internally in the `AmqpClient` implementation via `ProtonUtils` supporting class.
All send and receive methods return a `CompletableFuture` to get operation results eventually.
An interaction with plain objects require message body conversion and `SimpleMessageConverter` is used by default.
See `AmqpClient.Builder.messageConverter(MessageConverter)` configuration and xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc[] for more information about conversions.

Usually, just one bean like this is enough to perform all the possible send and receive operations:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
AmqpClient amqpClient(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return AmqpClient.builder(connectionFactory)
            .defaultToAddress("/queues/some_queue_as_default")
            .messageConverter(new JacksonJsonMessageConverter())
            .build();
}
----

NOTE: In the example before the `/queues/` prefix used for a `defaultToAddress` is an example of the destination address convention in https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/amqp#addresses[RabbitMQ].

Here are some samples of `AmqpClient` operations:

[source,java]
----
CompletableFuture<Boolean> sendFuture = this.amqpClient.send(Message.create("test_data"));
----

[source,java]
----
CompletableFuture<Boolean> sendFuture =
    this.amqpClient
            .to("/queues/" + TEST_SEND_QUEUE2)
            .message(new org.springframework.amqp.core.Message("test_data2".getBytes()))
            .send();
----

[source,java]
----
CompletableFuture<Boolean> sendFuture =
        this.amqpClient
                .to("/queues/" + TEST_SEND_QUEUE2)
                .body("convert")
                .priority(7)
                .header("test_header", "test_value")
                .messageId("some_id")
                .userId("guest")
                .send();
----

See Javadocs for those methods for more information about the fluent API exposed by the `AmqpClient`.
