== What's New

=== Changes in 3.0 Since 2.4

==== Java 17, Spring Framework 6.0

This version requires Spring Framework 6.0 and Java 17

==== Remoting

The remoting feature (using RMI) is no longer supported.

==== AsyncRabbitTemplate

IMPORTANT: The `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now returns `CompletableFuture` s instead of `ListenableFuture` s.
See <<async-template>> for more information.

==== Stream Support Changes

IMPORTANT: `RabbitStreamOperations` and `RabbitStreamTemplate` methods now return `CompletableFuture` instead of `ListenableFuture`.

Super streams and single active consumers thereon are now supported.

See <<stream-support>> for more information.

==== `@RabbitListener` Changes

Batch listeners can now consume `Collection<?>` as well as `List<?>`.
The batch messaging adapter now ensures that the method is suitable for consuming batches.
When setting the container factory `consumerBatchEnabled` to `true`, the `batchListener` property is also set to `true`.
See <<receiving-batch>> for more infoprmation.

`MessageConverter` s can now return `Optional.empty()` for a null value; this is currently implemented by the `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.
See <<Jackson2JsonMessageConverter-from-message>> for more information.

==== Connection Factory Changes

The default `addressShuffleMode` in `AbstractConnectionFactory` is now `RANDOM`. This results in connecting to a random host when multiple addresses are provided.
See <<cluster>> for more information.
