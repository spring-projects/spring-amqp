== What's New

=== Changes in 3.0 Since 2.4

==== Java 17, Spring Framework 6.0

This version requires Spring Framework 6.0 and Java 17

==== Remoting

The remoting feature (using RMI) is no longer supported.

==== Observation

Enabling observation for timers and tracing using Micrometer is now supported.
See <<micrometer-observation>> for more information.

[[x30-Native]]
==== Native Images

Support for creating native images is provided.
See <<native-images>> for more information.

==== AsyncRabbitTemplate

IMPORTANT: The `AsyncRabbitTemplate` now returns `CompletableFuture` s instead of `ListenableFuture` s.
See <<async-template>> for more information.

==== Stream Support Changes

IMPORTANT: `RabbitStreamOperations` and `RabbitStreamTemplate` methods now return `CompletableFuture` instead of `ListenableFuture`.

Super streams and single active consumers thereon are now supported.

See <<stream-support>> for more information.

==== `@RabbitListener` Changes

Batch listeners can now consume `Collection<?>` as well as `List<?>`.
The batch messaging adapter now ensures that the method is suitable for consuming batches.
When setting the container factory `consumerBatchEnabled` to `true`, the `batchListener` property is also set to `true`.
See <<receiving-batch>> for more information.

`MessageConverter` s can now return `Optional.empty()` for a null value; this is currently implemented by the `Jackson2JsonMessageConverter`.
See <<Jackson2JsonMessageConverter-from-message>> for more information

You can now configure a `ReplyPostProcessor` via the container factory rather than via a property on `@RabbitListener`.
See <<async-annotation-driven-reply>> for more information.

The `@RabbitListener` (and `@RabbitHandler`) methods can now be declared as Kotlin `suspend` functions.
See <<async-returns>> for more information.

Starting with version 3.0.5, listeners with async return types (including Kotlin suspend functions) invoke the `RabbitListenerErrorHandler` (if configured) after a failure.
Previously, the error handler was only invoked with synchronous invocations.

==== Connection Factory Changes

The default `addressShuffleMode` in `AbstractConnectionFactory` is now `RANDOM`.
This results in connecting to a random host when multiple addresses are provided.
See <<cluster>> for more information.

The `LocalizedQueueConnectionFactory` no longer uses the RabbitMQ `http-client` library to determine which node is the leader for a queue.
See <<queue-affinity>> for more information.
