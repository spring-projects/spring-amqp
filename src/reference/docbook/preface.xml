		The Spring AMQP project applies core Spring concepts to the development
		of AMQP-based messaging solutions. We provide a "template" as a high-level
		abstraction for sending and receiving messages. We also provide support
		for Message-driven POJOs. These libraries facilitate management of AMQP
		resources while promoting the use of dependency injection and declarative
		configuration. In all of these cases, you will see similarities to the
		JMS support in the Spring Framework. The project consists of both Java
		and .NET versions. This manual is dedicated to the Java version. For
		links to the .NET version's manual or any other project-related
		information visit the Spring AMQP project
