	/**
	 * Basic RPC pattern with conversion. Send a Java object converted to a message to a
	 * specific exchange with a specific routing key and attempt to receive a response,
	 * converting that to a Java object. Implementations will normally set the reply-to
	 * header to an exclusive queue and wait up for some time limited by a timeout.
	 * Requires a {@link org.springframework.amqp.support.converter.SmartMessageConverter}.
	 * @param exchange the name of the exchange.
	 * @param routingKey the routing key.
	 * @param message a message to send.
	 * @param messagePostProcessor a processor to apply to the message before it is sent.
	 * @param responseType the type to convert the reply to.
	 * @param <T> the type.
	 * @return the response; or null if the reply times out.
	 * @throws AmqpException if there is a problem.
	 * @since 2.0
